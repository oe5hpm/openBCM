\\ACTIVE
"Active Routing" was formerly developed by DL8HBS for DPBox.

This procedure calculates itself the best routing for usermails due to
permanent quality measurements with all forward partner bbs and due to
broadcast information of other mailboxes which can handle Active Routing.

p -sr      shows all known Active-Routing targets
wl <call>  shows a history overview of Active-Routing value of <call>

\\ADDRESS
Mails can be forwarded to other BBS. User mails will be erased after forward,
bulletins will be kept and therefore copies exist in other BBS. In user mails
always the address of the BBS is specified for which the mail is destinied.
This BBS has to be addressed clearly, i.e. the further away it is, the exacter
the address has to be specified. Generally speaking: mails into foreign
countries must contain the complete hierarchical address. If the recipient and
MYBBS is well known, the H-address is automatically added. The H-address of
each BBS world wide is defined by the sysop of that BBS. Do not change any
part of the H-address in addressing a user mail, otherwise your mail never
reaches target BBS.

The structure of such a hierarchical address is:
  DB0AAB.#BAY.DEU.EU
                  ^ Continent, EU stands for Europe
              ^ Country, DEU stands for Germany
         ^ Region of the country
   ^ Call of the BBS

Examples for continents:
AF   Africa     AS Asia         AU Australia       EU Europe
MDLE MiddleEast (e.g. Israel)   NA North America   SA South America

Examples for countries:
AUT Austria    CHE Switzerland      BEL Belgium   DEU Germany
DNK Denmark    FIN Finland          FRA France    HUN Hungary
ITA Italy      NLD Netherlands      SWE Sweden    SLO Slovenia
SVK Slovakia   TCH Czech Republik

In bulletins always a distribution address is specified. A distribution
address includes a group of BBS.

Examples of distribution addresses for bulletins:
BAY  Bavaria        DL  German speaking area  OE  Austria
USA  United States  EU  Europe                WW  World Wide

The distribution addresses ALL and ALLE should not be used any more and will
not be forwarded any longer.

Do not confuse the addressing of user mails with the one of bulletins! There
must be agreements about all addresses between sysops of BBS, regional for
regional addresses and world wide for word wide addresses. With DIR PATH you
get all valid addresses known by this BBS.
\\ADDLINUXSYS
(sysop, init.bcm, only linux)
Syntax: ADDLINUXSYSTEMUSER [ 0 | 1 ]
(Default: 0)

This sysop command "addlinuxsystemuser" can be set in init.bcm to value 0
(=deactivated) or 1 (=activated).

If it is set to 1, a user can define his user password for the mailbox
linux system with ALTER LINUXPW. OpenBCM adds this password to the linux
system files /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow. As loginshell "/bin/false" is used.
Deleting a user from the linux system is not possible at the moment from
inside OpenBCM, therefore the sysop must do this plain under the system if
this is desired.

The function "addlinuxsystemuser" is useful for those BBS system who wants
to add some TCP/IP features for their users (e.g. for TCP/IP mail accounts)
and whose sysops don't want to install either any other special packet radio
TCP/IP software or add TCP/IP linux system users manually.

Because the usershell is set to /bin/false, it's save that the users get
access to the system but don't get a real shell account.

See also HELP ALTER LINUXPW
\\AFWDLIST
(only sysop, option _AUTOFWD in config.h)
Syntax: AF(WDLIST)

This command generates the file "afwd.bcm" if "autofwdtime" is not set to 0.
To automatically update the autorouter, "afwdlist" should be called about once
a day via "crontab.bcm". AFWDLIST uses parameter AUTOFWDTIME. AUTOFWDTIME sets
number of days after which old routes are ignored. "AUTOFWDTIME 0" disables
autoforward.

Autoforward of mails is decided by:
   1.) checking "fwd.bcm" as usual, only if no route is found, use next.
   2.) checking "afwd.bcm"
   3.) looking up @address in H-address database (makes sense only for really
       new adresses, otherwise it should be found in "afwd.bcm"; however this
       method is quite fast, so no need to disable that)

See also HELP CRONTAB, HELP AUTOFWDT, HELP AUTOROUTER and HELP AUTOPATH
\\AKTUELL
Syntax: AK(TUELL)

With this command current information from the sysop will be displayed. This
text will also be displayed automatically if you connect the BBS and the text
has changed. These information are stored internally as "msg/aktuell.<lang>".
\\ALTBOARDINFO
(sysop, init.bcm)
Syntax: ALTBOARDINFO [ 0 | 1 ]
(default: 0)

If ALTBOARDINFO is set to "1" the boardinfo from "boardinf.bcm" is shown in
the line as the boardname. If set to "0" the output is done in two lines.
\\ALTER
Syntax: A(LTER) [ <call> | <subcommand> [<parameter>] ]

With ALTER you can change your personal settings in the BBS. ALTER without
any parameters shows your own settings. ALTER with <call> afterwards shows the
settings of the <call>.

Example:   A DL8MBT   displays settings of DL8MBT

Subcommands are:
ALTER AWAY..........to set the AWAY function
ALTER AWAYENDTIME...sets end time of AWAY function

ALTER MYBBS.........same as ALTER FORWARD, sets MYBBS
ALTER PROMPT........defines BBS prompt
ALTER PS............to set options for PS command
ALTER PW............to set an user password
ALTER PWLINE........output a dummy line before password
ALTER QTH...........sets own qth
ALTER READLOCK......read lock for own user mails
ALTER REJECT........boards that will not be shown
ALTER SFPWTYPE......password typ for AX25 S&F
ALTER SPEECH........defines a language
ALTER UDIR..........to set options for DIR of user mails
ALTER UFWD..........setup user S&F
ALTER ULIST.........to set options for LIST of user mails
ALTER UNSECURESMTP..to set security for SMTP
ALTER UREAD.........to set options for READ of user mails
ALTER ZIP...........sets own zip code

Example:   HELP ALTER FORWARD   show help for the setting of the MYBBS
\\ALTER.AWAY
Syntax: A(LTER) A(WAY) [ OFF | <text> ]

This command sets an away message and activates the away function. This
can be used to inform other user that you are away.

If ALTER AWAY <text> is defined, the sender of a message to this user
gets an automatic response message from the mailbox that the user is away.
The <text> is added to this message. <text> can be up to 79 characters.

It makes sense to add a duration to <text>.

Example:
a a I'm in holiday from 18.10.-23.10.03. 73 Markus

To disable the away function set "ALTER AWAY OFF" or "ALTER AWAY 0".

If you login in the mailbox after activating the away function, you are
prompted to disable the away function. With this, you can't forget to disable
the away function.

See also HELP ALTER AWAYENDTIME
\\ALTER.AWAYENDTIME
Syntax: A(LTER) AWAYE(NDTIME) [ OFF | <date> ]

This command can define a date, from that the away function is automatic
disable. This command is only available if the away function is
enabled with "A A <text>".

See also HELP ALTER AWAY
\\ALTER.BINMODE
Syntax: A(LTER) B(INMODE) [ AUTOBIN | YAPP | DIDADIT ]

This command selects the desired transport protocol for downloading binary
files. "ALTER BINMODE" shows your current mode.

See also HELP BIN, HELP YAPP and HELP DIDADIT
\\ALTER.C=ALTER.COMMAND
\\ALTER.CHECK
Syntax: A(LTER) CH(ECK) [<options>]

With this command you choose which information will be displayed, when you use
the CHECK command. Each option corresponds to one letter. If this letter is
specified the option is set, if this letter is missing the option is not set.
Options can be set/deleted if you put a +/- in front of this option.
Example:   A CH +Y   adds the option Y (show year at the date)

See also HELP OPTION DIR
\\ALTER.COMMAND
Syntax: A(LTER) C(OMMAND) <commands>

This command will be executed every time you connect the BBS. It is possible
to state more commands, seperated with ",".
("," is used, while a ";" executes the command).

Example:  A C U,L  at every login the users and your user mails will be listed
\\ALTER.DEFAULT
Syntax: A(LTER) D(EFAULT)

Sets the options to the default values. All personal settings will be lost!
Example: A DEF
\\ALTER.DELETE
(only sysop)
Syntax: A(LTER) DEL(ETE)

Erases all your personal settings entirely. An undo of this command is not
possible. The user entry is completely deleted in the user database! In
contrast to ALTER DEFAULT no standard values will be set.
\\ALTER.DIRFORMAT
Syntax: A(LTER) DIR(FORMAT) [ 0 | 1 ]

The date and time format of DIR/LIST/READ outputs can now by adjusted with.

Examples:
A DIR 0  german format:    31.05,  with option Y:  31.05.01
A DIR 1  ISO format:      010531,  with option Y:  20010531

See also HELP OPTION [CHECK | DIR | LIST | READ]
and HELP ALTER [C | ID | IL | IR | UD | UL | UR]
\\ALTER.ECHO
Syntax: A(LTER) E(CHO) [ 0 | 1 ]

With this command you can tell the BBS to send back every command you send.
That does not bother the PR net great, because the echo is directly appended
onto the answer. But this way you can assign a command with its result more
easily. The echo production is only active if packet radio interface of BCM is
used (not over console/file/modem).
\\ALTER.F=ALTER.FORWARD
\\ALTER.FBBCHECKMODE
Syntax: A(LTER) FB(BCHECKMODE) [ 0 | 1 ]
(default: 0)

Activates/deactivates the FBBCHECK mode for CHECK/READ commands. If the value
is set to "1", the FBBCHECK mode is activated, if set to "0" deactivated.
If FBBCHECK mode is avtivated, mails are listed when doing a CHECK with a
continuous number. When doing a "READ <nr>", where <nr> is a number of the
check list, the equivalent mail is displayed. This behaviour is the same as
mailboxsystem FBB and was recommented from a lot of formerly FBB users. More
FBB commands will not be implemented to OpenBCM!
\\ALTER.FD=ALTER.FDELAY
\\ALTER.FDELAY
Syntax: ALTER FD(ELAY) <min>
(default: 0)

Own mails will send to other BBS immediately but only after <min> delay.
The command is not completely implemented this time, perhaps mail will be
forwarded only after next POSTFWD command.
\\ALTER.FHOLD=SETUSER.FHOLD
\\ALTER.FORWARD
Syntax: A(LTER) F(ORWARD) [ [-L] <address> ]
(You may use NH, MY(BBS) or A(LTER) M(YBBS) instead)

Sets your MYBBS. All mails you get will be forwarded to this address. This
setting will be automatically forwarded to all neighboured BCM and Thebox BBS.
With the Option "-L" you can set a local MYBBS (no MYBBS forwarding).
Example:   A F DB0AAB.#BAY.DEU.EU   sets the MYBBS to DB0AAB.#BAY.DEU.EU

Current addresses can be listed with DIR PATH. For more detailed information
type HELP FORWARD.
\\ALTER.HELPLEVEL
Syntax: A(LTER) H(ELPLEVEL) [ 0 | 1 | 2 ]

Sets the helplevel. New users should have helplevel 2 with full prompts.
File "msg/cnew.<lang>" will be shown to user. Experts use "0", the menu at the
prompt is switched off. With helplevel "1" the extended connect text is
switched off, but the menu will be shown like in helplevel "2".

Example:   A H 1    sets the helplevel to 1
\\ALTER.HTTPSURFACE
Syntax: A(LTER) HT(TPSURFACE) [ 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 ]

Configures the look'n'feel of the HTTP surface.

   0 -> use the sysop default setting ("defhttpsurface")
   1 -> activates the simple surface with frames but without CSS support
   2 -> activates the nice surface without frames but with CSS support
   3 -> activates the simple surface without frames and without CSS support

Example:       a ht 0

See also HELP DEFHTTPSURFACE
\\ALTER.IDIR
Syntax: A(LTER) ID(IR) [<options>]

With this command you choose which information will be displayed, when you
list bulletins with the DIR command. Each option corresponds to one letter.
If this letter is specified the option is set, if this letter is missing the
option is not set. Options can be set/deleted if you put a +/- in front of
this option.
Example:   A ID +Y   adds the option Y (show year at the date)

See HELP OPTION DIR and HELP ALTER DIRFORMAT
\\ALTER.ILIST
Syntax: A(LTER) IL(IST) [<options>]

With this command you choose which information will be displayed, when you
list bulletins with the LIST command. Each option corresponds to one letter.
If this letter is specified the option is set, if this letter is missing the
option is not set. Options can be set/deleted if you put a +/- in front of
this option.
Example:   A IL +Y   adds the option Y (show year at the date)

See HELP OPTION LIST
\\ALTER.IREAD
Syntax: A(LTER) IR(EAD) [<options>]

With this command you choose which information will be displayed when you
read mails from bulletins. Each option corresponds to one letter. If this
letter is specified the option is set, if this letter is missing the option
is not set. Options can be set/deleted if you put a +/- in front of this
option.
Example:   A IR +Y   adds the option Y (show year at the date)

See HELP OPTION READ
\\ALTER.L=ALTER.LINES
\\ALTER.LF
Syntax: A(LTER) LF [ -1 ... 5 ]
(default: 0)

Number of empty lines between the outputs. With "A LF 1" you get one empty
line between outputs. With "A LF 0" this extra line isn't shown. If a value
of -1 is defined, the extra empty line before each output is also suppressed.

Example:   A LF 1   puts an empty line between the outputs
\\ALTER.LINES
Syntax: A(LTER) L(INES) [<n>]
(default: 0)

Number of lines the BBS sends until it waits for ENTER. Switch off the
pagebreak with A L 0.
Example:   A L 20   sets Pagebreak to 20 lines

See also HELP PAGEBREAK
\\ALTER.LINUXPW
(only linux)
Syntax: A(LTER) LINUX(PW) <password>

ALTER LINUXPW <password> defines the user password of the linux system.
The maximum lenght should be 8 characters. To make this function available,
ADDLINUXSYSTEMUSER must be set to 1 in init.bcm!

See also HELP ADDLINUXSYSTEMUSER
\\ALTER.LOGINPWTYPE
Syntax:  A(LTER) LO(GINPWTYPE) [ BAYCOM | MD2 | MD5 | INACTIVE ]

Sets the password typ for AX25 login definitions.

See also HELP PASSWORD
\\ALTER.MYBBS=ALTER.FORWARD
\\ALTER.NAME
Syntax: A(LTER) N(AME) [<name>]
(You may use N(AME) instead)

You can tell the BBS your name with this command. This name will be stated in
the header of every mail you send. Other BCM will extract this name from the
header and save it.

Example:   A N Flori   sets Flori as name
\\ALTER.NEWCALL
Syntax: A(LTER) NE(WCALL) [<call>]

If you got a better licence and you got a new call after that, you can setup
your new call to your old user settings. If a mail reaches the old call, the
mail will be forwarded automatically to your new call that you setup here.
\\ALTER.NOPURGE
Syntax: A(LTER) NO(PURGE) [ 0 | 1 ]

This command is only available, if sysop has set "NOPURGE 2". If set to "1",
mails for you can not be purged by the BBS.

See also HELP PURGE CMDS and HELP NOPURGE
\\ALTER.NOTIFICATION
Syntax: A(LTER) NOT(IFICATION) [<call>]

If you have a club callsign, but do not login very often with this club
callsign into BBS, it makes sense to inform your callsign each time when
the club callsign gets a new mail. Therefore you can use ALTER NOTIFICATION
for this.
\\ALTER.PACLEN
(Sysop, parts inactive)
Syntax: A(LTER) PAC(LEN) [<Bytes>]
(default: 0)

Sysops can setup for each user a shorter paclen. Default is set by PACLEN.
Syntax for sysops:    SETUSER <call> PACLEN 40..255  or  0

The value set for user can be shown with "ALTER <call> PACLEN", but only if
you are sysop and PACLEN option is active.

See also HELP PACLEN
\\ALTER.PASSWORD=ALTER.PW
\\ALTER.PROMPT
Syntax: A(LTER) P(ROMPT) [<prompt string>]

Sets the prompt of the BBS. It is possible to use macros in this command.

Example:
  A P (%b)-->   the current board is issued with the prompt
  A P           sets the default prompt

See also HELP MACROS and HELP DEFPROMPT
\\ALTER.PS
Syntax: A(LTER) PS [<options>]

Sets options for PS command.

Example:   A PS UR

See HELP OPTIONS PS
\\ALTER.PW
Syntax: A(LTER) PW [ <string> | OFF | DISABLE ]

With this command you can set your own password if enabled by sysop.
  a pw <string>  <string> will be appended to an existing password (maybe you
                 want delete it before? - make "a pw" before!)
  a pw           Without a parameter your password is deleted
  a pw off       Disables totally the password, can only reseted by the sysop
  a pw disable   Sysop can switch off your password function

The maximum size is 39 characters. The password must not contain the signs ";"
and ",". If a password is set and you connect the BBS, there will no longer
appear the connect text but something like this (depends on LOGINPWTYPE):
DB0AAB> 2 4 34 22 1

Now you must send the corresponding signs of the password string back. If a
password is set, your MYBBS can only be changed in the BBS which was specified
as MYBBS before.

With AT PW DISABLE sysops can switch off the password function.

See also HELP PASSWORD, HELP ALTER LOGINPW, HELP ALTER PWLINE and
HELP ALTER READLOCK
\\ALTER.PWLINE
Syntax: A(LTER) PWL(INE) [ 0 | 1 ]
(default: 0)

In some terminal programs you must send something like "pw" or "sy" to the
BBS before the terminal program answers to the password prompt from the BBS.
If you set A PWLINE 1 you must send a line to the BBS before it tests the
password. So it is possible to create the password automatically in most
terminal programs.

See HELP ALTER PW
\\ALTER.QTH
Syntax: A(LTER) QT(H) [ <string> ]

You can define the QTH with this command, e.g. "A QT Stuttgart".
\\ALTER.R=ALTER.REJECT
\\ALTER.READLOCK
Syntax: A(LTER) REA(DLOCK) [ 0 | 1 | 2 ]
(default: 0)

If you do not want that everyone can read your mails, you can reduce this
using this command.

  ALTER READLOCK 0  everyone can read all your mails
  ALTER READLOCK 1  at DIR/LIST/READ only own mails and mails that are already
                    read appear
  ALTER READLOCK 2  at DIR/LIST/READ only own mails appear

See HELP ALTER PW
\\ALTER.REJECT
Syntax: A(LTER) R(EJECT) [-R] <board list>

Here you can specify bulletin boards that will not be listed using the CHECK
and DIR NEWS commands. So you can switch off undesired boards. If you specify
a mainboard, DIR NEWS will not list the subboards, too. CHECK will list
subboards, even if the mainboard is specified in the reject list. With the
option "-R" you can reverse the selection. This way only the specified boards
will be listed.

Examples:  A R DEBAT IBM            does not list the boards DEBAT and IBM
           A R -R DXNEWS SOFTWARE   only lists the boards DXNEWS and SOFTWARE

NEW: Also senders or areas can besides the reject board list. Senders can be
marked with preceding "<", areas with "@".

Example:    ALTER R DEBAT <DF3IAH @WW
            fades all lines, that hits one of the three criterions

See HELP CHECK and HELP DIR
\\ALTER.S=ALTER.SPEECH
\\ALTER.SFPWTYPE
Syntax:  A(LTER) SF(PWTYPE) [ BAYCOM | MD2 | MD5 | INACTIVE ]

Sets the password typ for AX25 S&F definitions.

See also HELP PASSWORD and HELP ALTER PW
\\ALTER.SPEECH
Syntax: A(LTER) S(PEECH) [<language>]

Without a parameter this command shows a list of selectionable system
languages. In brackets, the beginnings of those callsigns are shown, that got
this language as default value. These callsign values can be set by sysop in
file "speech.bcm". The first line of "msg/messages.*" includes a discribtion
of the language file with a version number which is also shown when you type
"a s".

If you add <language> to this command, you get some system messages in that
language.

Examples:   A S GB   selects english messages
            A S DL   selects german messages
\\ALTER.STATUS
(only sysop)
Syntax: A(LTER) ST(ATUS) [<n>]

Possible settings are:
  0  default
  1  no quota limits
  2  user disabled
  3  user disabled and sysop gets mail
  4  user gets "msg/cstat4.<lang>" file, sysop gets mail, after that user
     gets status 2
  8  no mailserv, fileserv, transfer possible for user
     (needed against "spamer").

See also HELP SETUSER
\\ALTER.TTYPW
(only sysop)
Syntax: A(LTER) TTYPW [<password>]

Notice: maximum length is 8 characters!
\\ALTER.UDIR
Syntax: A(LTER) UD(IR) <options>

With this command you choose which information will be displayed, when you
list user mails with DIR command. Each option corresponds to one letter. If
this letter is specified the option is set, if this letter is missing the
option is not set. Options can be set/deleted if you put a +/- in front of
this option.

Example:   A UD +Y   adds the option Y (show year at the date)

See HELP OPTION DIR
\\ALTER.UFWD
Syntax: A(LTER) UF(WD) <boxcall> <digicall> [<entry digicall>]
        A(LTER) UF(WD) PASSIVE
        A(LTER) UF(WD) OFF
        A(LTER) UF(WD)

The user S&F can be activated and a connect path to the user BBS can be setup.

<boxcall> is the call with SSID of the own BBS. As SSID -8 is proposed. This
call can be however also another call than the usercall, for example that of a
club station...
<digicall> <entry digicall> are calls of nodes between this BBS and the user
BBS, seen from this BBS to the user BBS.

Example: OE3FRU will like to do S&F with his WinGT mailbox system to the BCM
BBS OE3XSR-8. The WinGT mailbox system is configured as "OE3FRU-8". OE3FRU's
entry digi is OE3XNR-3, his MYBBS is OE3XSR-8, between is the digi OE3XSR.

   BCM BBS       boxdigi    entry digi     user BBS
   oe3xsr-8 <==> oe3xsr <==> oe3xnr-3 <==> oe3fru-8

   => ALTER UFWD OE3FRU-8 OE3XSR OE3XNR-3

There are following possibilities for the user S&F:
ALTER UFWD OE3DZW OE3XSR-3  This BBS tries to connect to user BBS when a new
                            mail for that call arives in this BBS, connect
                            path is the path set with ALTER UFWD
ALTER UFWD PASSIVE          no active connection from BBS to the user BBS, the
                            user BBS must connect to fetch all waiting mails
ALTER UFWD OFF              user S&F is disabled
ALTER UFWD                  shows the current settings

See also HELP UFWD
\\ALTER.ULIST
Syntax: A(LTER) UL(IST) <options>

With this command you choose which information will be displayed, when you
list user mails with LIST command. Each option corresponds to one letter. If
this letter is specified the option is set, if this letter is missing the
option is not set. Options can be set/deleted if you put a +/- in front of
this option.

Example:   A UL +Y   adds the option Y (show year at the date)

See HELP OPTION DIR
\\ALTER.UNSECURESMT
(Linux/Win32)
Syntax: ALTER UN(SECURESMTP) [ 0 | 1 ]
(default: 0)

Normally (value "0") it is possible to do SMTP only after POP3, e.g. a mail
can be only send by TCP/IP if another mail was picked up previously. With
value "1" it is also possible to do SMTP without preceding POP3. The setting
to "1" can be a security hole, especially if BBS is accessable via internet.

See also HELP SMTP, HELP APOP
\\ALTER.UREAD
Syntax: A(LTER) UR(EAD) <options>

With this command you choose which information will be displayed, when you
read user mails. Without <options> your settings are displayed. Each option
corresponds to one letter. If this letter is specified the option is set, if
this letter is missing the option is not set. Options can be set/deleted if
you put a +/- in front of this option.

Example:   A UR +Y   adds the option Y (show year at the date)

See HELP OPTION READ
\\ALTER.ZIP
Syntax: A(LTER) Z(IP) [ <string> ]

You can define the Zip-Code with this command, e.g. "A Z D-59302".
\\AP=APPEND
\\APOP
Extension for POP with encoded authentification, so POP is possible if a
password for login is set. This expansion is supported at the moment by the
terminal program "WPP".
\\APPEND
(only sysop)
Syntax: AP(PEND) "<textline>" <filename>

Attaches a textline to an existing file.
Example:   APPEND "" test.txt    attaches a return to file "test.txt"
A semicolon may not be contained in <textline>.
\\ASKLOGIN
(only sysop, init.bcm)
Syntax: ASKLOGIN [ 0 | 1 ]
(default: 0)

If ASKLOGIN is set to "1" everyone who is logging into BBS the first time
is asked about his name, qth, zip-code and MYBBS. If the BBS is using
USERQUOTA he is also ask, if he wants to get an active member of this BBS
(for no downloadlimits, better userstatus etc). The sysop gets a mail if a
user answers with YES. If ASKLOGIN is set to "0" no login asking is shown.

See also HELP USERQUOTA
\\AUTOBIN=BINARY
\\AUTOFWDTIME
(only sysop, init.bcm, option _AUTOFWD in config.h)
Syntax: AUTOFWDT(IME) [<days>]
(default: 0)

Sets number of days after which old routes are ignored for generating
"afwd.bcm" with "afwdlist". 0 days disables the autorouter.

See also H AFWDLIST, H AUTOROUTER and H AUTOPATH
\\AUTOPATH
(Option _AUTOFWD in config.h)
Syntax: AUTOP(ATH) [-a] <boxcall>

Shows if autorouter knows a path to <boxcall>. When using option "-a" all
information of <boxcall> are shown.

See also HELP AUTOROUTER
\\AUTOROUTER
(only sysop, option _AUTOFWD in config.h)
The autorouter is only used for S&F, if no route is found in "fwd.bcm".

"afwdlist"            creates the file "afwd.bcm" if "autofwdtime" is not 0.
"autofwdtime 0"       disables the autorouter.
"autofwdtime n"       sets number of days after which old routes are ignored.
"autopath <boxcall>"  shows, if a route to <boxcall> is found by autorouter.

The file "temp/afwd1.tmp" is only for information about routes, and not used.
This information file has the following format:
<S&F partner> <Target BBS-Callsign + Header>

The autorouter calculates the path from the number of the intervening other
BBS and the delay until a mail arrived in the BBS.

See also HELP AFWDLIST, HELP AUTOFWDTIME and HELP AUTOPATH
\\AUTOSYSOP
(only sysop, asysop.bcm)

Autosysop enables automatic sysop status on certain ports just after login.
The entry of password is not necessary. The settings can be edited in file
"asysop.bcm" and should be a good secret!

Format of "asysop.bcm":
    call uplink downlink
Example:
    DJJ812 none none          (directly connectable)
    DJJ812 DBO812-2 DBO812-2  (if the SSID of entry ports is -2)

If the up- or downlink should contain nothing, "none" must be declared.
Downlink is the call of node or digipeater, that is closest to the BBS. Uplink
is the call of node, that is the farthest from the BBS, as well that node over
that the users gets into the packet network.

Notice:
The uplink can be easily falsified, downlink theoretically never, since it is
usually the own one.

- uplink using an IP login it's the IP address, that can also be used
- is uplink and downlink declared as "none", it is a direct connect without
  node or digipeater between it
- If a digi possesses the SSID 0 or no SSID, the call is valid without SSID
\\AUTOTRCWIN
(only sysop, init.bcm, only DOS, option _AUTOTRCWIN in config.h)
Syntax: AUTOT(RCWIN) [ 0 | 1 ]
(default: 0)

With "1" a trace window should be generated automatically, otherwise off.
\\AX25KERNEL=AX25K_IF
\\AX25K_IF
(only sysop, init.bcm, only Linux)
Syntax: AX25K_IF [ <interface> [d] | off ]
(default: off)

With this parameter the AX25 kernel support is activated. <interface> is the
hardware address (call of the port) where BCM is doing all receive/transmit
activities, independent from that. BCM is using parameter MYCALL to set
callsign for login and S&F. The parameter "d" is optional. If this Parameter
is set, AX25 kernel interface is the default interface for all connects.
Otherwise the AX25 kernel interface must be declared, e.g. "ax25:<interface>".

See also HELP CONNECT
\\B=BYE
\\BA=BATCH
\\BAKE=BEACON
\\BATCH
(only sysop)
Syntax: BA(TCH) <filename>

First <filename>.bat and afterwards <filename>.imp is executed. With this,
entries of "crontab.bcm" can be tested. Note: <filename> must be without
extension!

See also HELP CRONTAB
\\BAYCOM

\\BBS
BBS is the abbreviation for "Bulletin Board System", the mailbox.
\\BCM
BCM is the abbreviation for "BayCom Mailbox".

\\BCMNET
(Sorry, only in german, because it's only used in german cb network!)

BCMNET steht im CB-Funk fuer ein eigenstaendiges Netzwerk aus OpenBCM
Mailboxen, die sich zum Ziel gesetzt haben, ein funktionierendes Netzwerk
aufzubauen.

Im CB-Funk gibt es das Problem, dass die Rufzeichen nicht koordiniert sind
und daher mehrfach vorkommen koennen. Außerdem gibt es Zeitgenossen, welche
nichts besseres zu tun haben als das Netz durch die Benutzung bereits
vergebener Rufzeichen durcheinander zu bringen. Das Netz ist damit
verwundbar. Aus diesem Grund wurde das BCMNET Loginkonzept mit schaltbarer
Sicherheitsstufe (pwonly) erarbeitet und zusammen mit dem Hannes, AT5HPK,
implementiert.

Funktionsprinzip des Loginkonzeptes fuer das CB-BCMNET:

In eine Mailbox ohne generellen Passwortzugang (PWONLY=0) kann sich nur
jeder vollwertig einloggen, wenn
-	es sich dabei um ein Rufzeichen handelt, welches in unserem Netz
        noch nicht bekannt ist, wo also noch kein MyBBS-Eintrag empfangen
        wurde.
-	ein vorhandener MyBBS-Eintrag aelter als ein halbes Jahr ist, also
        davon ausgegangen werden kann, dass dieses Call nicht mehr benutzt
        wird.
-	Das MyBBS gleich dieser Mailbox ist, sich der User also in seine
        Heimatmailbox einloggt.
-	Auch dann wenn es sich nicht um die Heimatmailbox des Users handelt,
        der User aber ein Passwort in dieser Mailbox hat.

Jeder User fuer den keiner dieser Punkte zutrifft, wird automatisch als
Gast eingeloggt. Als Gast hat man vollen Mailboxzugriff, mit folgenden
Einschränkungen:
-	Alle Mails welche eingespielt werden, bleiben lokal in dieser
        Mailbox liegen und werden nicht geforwardet, bis der Sysop diese
        nach Sicht manuell in den Forward stellt.
-	Einstellungen wie der Name und die MyBBS werden nicht uebernommen,
        und einige Mailboxbefehle wie erase, transfer,... lassen sich nicht
        benutzen.
-	Alle benutzerdefinierten Einstellungen gelten nur für diesen Login
        und werden nicht gespeichert.

Bei Mailboxen mit generellem Passwortzugang (PWONLY=1) wird zusaetzlich noch
geprueft, ob fuer den User der eines der obigen Punkte erfuellen konnte, ein
gueltiges Passwort gesetzt ist, ansonsten wird er ebenfalls automatisch als
Gast eingeloggt.

Mails welche von einem Gast eingespielt wurden, werden mit
    X-Info: Mail was sent from a guest
im Header gekennzeichnet.

Die Dateien "msg/bnguest.*" und "msg/bnpwonly.*" werden nur bei dem BCMNET
Loginkonzept verwendet. Hier sollten Hinweistexte ausgegeben werden, die auf
das BCMNET Loginkonzept und seine Restriktionen hinweist.
\\BEACON
(only sysop)
Syntax: BE(ACON) [<text>]

Sends a beacon for testing purpose. Overwise the beacon is sent at times
defined in "crontab.bcm".

If a text is declared, this text is sent as beacon.

To target ist configured in "beacon.bcm":
        DOS:         <mycall> <tocall> [<viadigi>... ]
        Linux/Win32: <tocall> [<viadigi>... ]
To send a global beacon header each time, add a file "beachead.bcm"
with the desired text.
\\BEFEHLE=CMD
\\BEGIN
(only sysop)
Syntax: BEG(IN) <filename>

Shows the first 2 KByte of a textfile.

See also HELP TAIL
\\BENUTZER=USERS
\\BI=BIDLIST
\\BID
BID is the abbreviation for "Bulletin IDentification". This is an unique
identification string for each mail.

See also HELP BIDLIST
\\BIDLIST
Syntax: BI(DLIST) [-option] <search string>

This command lists the internal BID database. <search string> can be any part
of a BID or filename. Only lines with <search string> match will be displayed.
Also the filenames are saved. So a search after a remote erase is not
necessary.

Example:   BI DB0RGB   lists the BIDs of all mails that were entered
                       in DB0RGB

It's possible to use an option with BIDLIST, following options are available:
  BI(DLIST) -c       counts all known BIDs
  BI(DLIST) -k       shows BIDs with collisions
  BI(DLIST) -h       shows hash settings
  BI(DLIST) -s <BID> manual edit of BID
  BI(DLIST) -i       shows all received mail BIDs
\\BIDOFFSET
(only sysop, init.bcm)
This parameter is only needed if more than one BBS are using same callsign.
Syntax: BIDO(FFSET) [ 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 ]
(default: 0)

First BBS have to set 0, second BBS should use 1, etc.
This parameter is used, that different BID's are generated in those BBS.
"bidoffset 0" is not added to "init.bcm", only if value is > 0.
\\BINARY
How to exchange binary files with this BBS
------------------------------------------
1st: How to send a binary file to the BBS:
- Enter the send command as usual and the title
- Enter any text as usual, e.g. instructions or information
- Start the autobin or DIDADIT send in your terminal to send the file.
  After the transfer is complete the file will be closed automatically and the
  BBS sends a CRC and the prompt. No "nnnn" or Ctrl-Z is needed to close the
  file. Filenames have to be less than 50 characters, if they are longer they
  will be truncated, but filename extension will be kept.

2nd: How to read a binary file from the BBS:
- Start the autobin in your terminal if it is not done automatically
- Send the read command to the BBS as usual, the BCM BBS starts the autobin
  automatically. How and where the files are saved depends on your terminal
  program.

Binary mails/files are marked with (BIN) in front of the title at DIR/LIST.
This happens automatically. The title the user typed in appears after (BIN).

See also HELP ALTER BINMODE, HELP YAPP and HELP DIDADIT
\\BIN-RX
BIN-RX is ignored by the BBS.
\\BIN-TX
BIN-TX is ignored by the BBS.
\\BOARD
A board contains mails, which are destinied for a certain topic or user.
There are two types of boards:

 - user boards:      The users private boards, where the user mails are kept.
                     These mails only can be deleted by the recipient or by
                     the sender.
 - bulletin boards:  Public boards where mails are stored which could be read
                     by everyone. Only the sender is allowed to delete them.
                     These mails are called bulletins.

Every board has an unique name with which you can address it. In userboards
this is the users call. In bulletin boards the name describes the subject
area (e.g. SOFTWARE, IBM).

Every mail in a board has a number. The oldest mail has number 1. With the
DIR or LIST command the mails of a board can be listed.

A board can contain other boards. That means, a mainboard can have several
subboards. Subboards of subboards are not allowed ("DIR BOARDS").

Every board has a lifetime, which is determined by the BBS sysop. It indicates
how many days the mails stay in the board before they are deleted
automatically.

The boardname is part of a lot of commands, e.g. DIR/LIST/READ/ERASE/CHECK.
The BCM BBS always keeps the name of the last board, which was used and uses
it when the board is not specified in a command. The board can be changed
either when it is specefied in one of the command above or with CD command.
If the boardname only consists of numbers, the board can only be changed using
the CD command.

As the boardnames are made to paths under DOS, you must remember the
following restrictions:
- The signs "/" and "\" are exchanged by an "_"
- Names of DOS devices (e.g. CON, NUL, etc.) are impossible
- Only signs can be used that may be used in DOS filenames

The boardnames AUTO7P, REQ*, 7PSERV, FILSRV, FNDFIL and WWCALL are treated
like userboards.
\\BOARDINF
(only sysop, boardinf.bcm)
In file "boardinf.bcm" descriptions of boards can be added. These descriptions
are shown with DIR or LIST commands. The format is:
      boardname description
If no description is added in file "boardinf.bcm" for one board, logically no
description is shown.
\\BOXADRESS
(only sysop, init.bcm)
Syntax: BOXA(DRESS) [<H-address>}

Defines call and country area of the BBS. Must be correct set for S&F.
Following text explains the international usual hierarchical notation.
Example:   BOXADRESS DB0AAB.#BAY.DEU.EU

The hierarchical address consists of the call of the BBS (without SSID), the
regional identifier, the name of the state (ISO) and the continent:
          <call>.#<region>.<state>.<continent>
Example:  OE3XSR.#OE3.AUT.EU

If the BBS is not 24h opened, the address should be like following:
          <call>.<pop-box>.#<region>.<state>.<continent>
<pop-box> is that BBS, where mails should be exchanged with.
Example:  OE1XAR.OE1XAB.#OE1.AUT.EU

See also HELP ADDRESS
\\BOXBIN=BINARY
\\BOXHEADER
(only sysop, init.bcm)
Syntax: BOXH(EADER) [<text>]

Defines the text, that is written in the R: headerlines. The headerline is
only added to a mail if the mail is writen in this BBS. Only time and address
is inserted at the pure passageway. Only standard ASCII characters should be
used in the boxheader. Do not use IBM characters above 127 or country specifiy
letters.

Example:   BOXHEADER Muenchen-Nord Op:DL8MBT

If the header text of the BBS is defined as "BayCom-Mailbox" (default after
installation) no automatic mails are generated (for test or user S&F).
\\BULLETIN
A bulletin is a mail to everyone (public mail). It can be read by all stations
but can be only deleted by the sender and/or the BBS sysop. Depending on its
topic it is part of a certain board. It will be deleted when its lifetime has
expired. To send a bulletin you have to use a distribution address, see
HELP ADDRESS.

In contrary to bulletins there are mails to users (user mails). They can be
deleted by the sender, the recipient and the BBS sysop. They have a lifetime,
too.
\\BYE
Syntax: B(YE)

Using this command, you can leave the BBS. In contrary to the QUIT command the
logoff date will not be set.
\\C=CHECK
\\CALL
(only sysop)
Syntax: CA(LL) <call>

Like LOGIN, executes no complete login, only switch to the call of the user.
To change user settings, "SETUSER <call> <item>" is more practical.

See also HELP SETUSER
\\CALLFORMAT
(only sysop, init.bcm)
Syntax: CALLF(ORMAT) [ 0 | 1 | 2 ]
(default: 0)

With this parameter, the call valid check routine can be switched between
ham radio calls and citizen band calls.

CALLFORMAT 0... only ham radio calls are allowed to connect
CALLFORMAT 1... only citizen band calls are allowed to connect
CALLFORMAT 2... both (ham radio & citizen band calls) are allowed

If "0" isn't used, "(CB)" (for citizen band) is added to connect text of BBS.
\\CAT=RTEXT
\\CHECK
Syntax: C(HECK) [<range>] [ [<] "<search-pattern>" ]

The CHECK command lists all mails in the bulletin boards in the order of
their arrival in the BBS. The mails are sorted in order of the date, begining
with the oldest mail. If you specify a range, only the specified mails will
be listed (e.g. "CHECK -5" lists the five newest mails).

If no range is specified, only the mails will be listed which arrived since
your last CHECK. If you write a "<" followed by a blank and a string, only
the mails which include this string will be listed. You can leave out the
"<", it only is accepted to be compatible to the Thebox. The search pattern
is used as regular expression. Up-/low-case letters are of no matter.
You may use the commands DIR NEWS or DIR MESSAGES instead of CHECK.

Examples:   C            Lists all mails, which arrived after your last CHECK.
            C -10        Lists the 10 newest bulletin mails.
            C 1- DL8MBT  Lists all mails, which were sent by DL8MBT.
            C FT470      Lists all mails, which include 'FT470' in the title.

See also HELP OPTION CHECK and HELP REGULAR_EXPRESSIONS
\\CHECK.OPTION=OPTION.CHECK
\\CHECKCOUNT
Syntax: CHECKC(COUNT)

Shows the number of new messages since the last call of "check" in the
mailbox. Maybe useful as login command.
\\CD
Syntax: CD <boardname>

Changes the current board (will be shown at the prompt). CD without boardname
changes the current board to own userboard.

Example:   CD 144MHZ   Changes the current board to <144mhz>.
\\CEDIT
(only sysop, only DOS)
Syntax: CE(DIT)

Same as "EDIT CONVNAME.BCM". Don't forget "NEW" command after edit, if you
want to activate changes you made. Linux/Win32 versions execute "CONVEDIT"
command instead.
\\CFGFLEX
(only sysop)
Syntax: CF(GFLEX) [flexcall]

Sends a flexnet configuration file to "flexcall" digi. The configuration file
"cfgflex.bcm" must exist in BCM home directory. For success the BBS must have
a "y" flag at flexnet digi.

Example of "cfgflex.bcm":
------------
w c
Sternberg - Your flexnet node
/ex
w l
New BCM version installed
/ex
-------------
\\CHAT=TALK
\\CLOG
(only sysop)
Syntax: CLOG ["<search string>"]

Shows last 2 kBytes of file "trace/cmdlog.bcm". All sysop commands are logged
here. If you add <search string> all lines where this string is found will be
shown. You only need " " if <search string> should contain spaces. You can use
as <search string> also date or time string. The <search string> is handled as
regular expression.

See also HELP REGULAR_EXPRESSIONS
\\CMDLIST
Syntax: CM(DLIST)

Shows all user commands. HELP CMDS shows a little commented overview
over all user commands.

Sysops commands can be listed with SCMDLIST, see also HELP SCMDLIST.
\\CMDS

\\COMMAND=CMD
\\COMMENT
Syntax: COM(MENT) [ [<board>] <range> ] [<title>]

After reading a bulletin you can easily reply to that mail with command
COMMENT (without parameter). All needed information (call, title) will be
taken from readed mail. If title didn't contain a "Re:" the call of sender
will be included to title.
\\CONNECT
(only sysop, not possible via air connect)
Syntax: CONN(ECT) [interface:<hw-addr>] <call> <digi>

With this command it's possible to connect from sysop console to others. This
possibility is not very comfortable but working. To disconnect use :D command.
If you want to connect via Linux AX25 kernel you have to add interface and
hardware address (call of interface).

Example: connect ax25:db0aab-13 oe3dzw db0aab
\\CONVAT
Syntax: CONV(AT)

Shows file "convat.bcm". This file is used to kick off old areas some BBS
misuse long time.

Example for "convat.bcm":
; Format: <oldat> <newat>
oedl dl
dloe dl
alle dl
oeba dl
all  ww
euro eu
aut  oe

The conversion is only done if bulletins are written local to BBS. Areacode
received via forward will not be changed, but e.g. mail @oedl will be
forwarded like @dl if a conversion @oedl -> @dl is setup in "convat.bcm".
\\CONVEDIT
(only sysop)
Syntax: CONVED(IT) add <sourceboard> <targetboard> [[LT] [string]]
        CONVED(IT) del <board>
        CONVED(IT) list [<board>]
        CONVED(IT) sort

With CONVEDIT you can add, delete and list entries of file "convert.bcm".
"convert.bcm" will be updated automatically after changing.

With CONVEDIT SORT all entries of file "convert.bcm" can be sorted
alphanumerically. You should ONLY do this, if the order of all entries is not
important, because only the first match is token!

See also HELP CONVERT and HELP CONVERT EXAMPLE
\\CONVERS=TALK
\\CONVERT
Syntax: CONVER(T) [ -a | <search string> ]

Shows content of file "convert.bcm". If you add option "-a", the whole file is
displayed. <search string> is handled as regular expression. This file is used
for automatic transfer of bulletins. Also maximum lifetime can be changed for
single mails. If you use <search string> only lines containing <search string>
are shown. If you type in only "convert" without anything else, the last
2 kbytes of "convert.bcm" is shown.

Syntax of file:

; = comment
A line without comment can only exceed max. 54 signs. With comment it can only
be 80 chars incl. CR/LF!.

Letters with special meaning: < @ ~ $ % &
 <call          sender
 @address       BBS call or region
 ~word          search whole words in title
 text           search "text" in title
You have to use %, $ and & without arguments.
 $              received from other BBS via S&F
 %              user input
 &              user input without password

Use only space and no tab's for separation in lines.

The order is important, because only the first match is token. So be aware of
sorting the lines in "convert.bcm".

Several conditions can be declared for AND. To reach OR condition, use a
new line. All conditions must always be matched. Capital or small letters
are irrelevant.

A word is surrounded from spaces, therefore ~NO means " NO ", or if it stands
at the title beginning: "NO ", and if it stands on the end of title " NO".

Lifetime must be defined with three characters. Lifetime 000 means that the
maximum lifetime from file "bulletin.bcm" is used (not Lifetime 0 days!).
Lifetime of 0 is not possible with "convert.bcm", lifetime of 1 is the minimum
value and should be enough, but only, if minimal lifetime from "bulletin.bcm"
is not exceeded. The maximum lifetime from "bulletin.bcm" can be exceeded by
"convert.bcm".

If a lifetime is added to a convert line, also a mode/scan title must be
added! This means for example:

CQDX   DX          ; is ok (transfers all mails from board CQDX to DX)
CQDX   DX   005    ; is wrong (mode/scan title is missing)
CQDX   DX   005  $ ; is ok (transfers board CQDX to DX with lifetime of
                   ;        5 days if received via S&F)

You can use regular expression with <, @, and text, but not with ~.

The joker character "*" can be used, but an entry with an "*" each for
source and target board is not possible!

Lists lists the mails of <board>. <board> can either be the board of an user
(then <board> is the call of the user) or the name of a bulletin board. If
you do not specify a board, the mails of the current board will be listed.
You can specify a range and <search string>, to list certain mails. Options
can be specified in general or directly at the command. See HELP ALTER and
HELP OPTION. To set an option you must type "-" with the option behind, to
switch off an option type the option and "-" after it (e.g. "D -V- SOFTWARE").
Upper-/lowercase letters are of no matter.

Examples:   D IBM            Lists all mails in the board <IBM>.
            D -V SOFTWARE    Lists mails in the board <SOFTWARE>; also list
                             erased mails.

)     mail is not read
R     mail has been read
r     mail has been replied
E     mail is erased
F     mail is forwarded
H     mail is set on hold status
W     distinguished as WP mail, deleted afterwards

                      current year.
\\DIR.BOARDS
Syntax: D(IR) B(OARDS) [<search string>]

If no parameter is specified, all current existing boards will be listed.
There are main and subboards. Beginning in the first column the mainboards
will be listed and after them their subboards beginning in second column
(hierarchical bulletinsystem).

Example:   D B

If you state <search string>, all boards, which include <search string> in
their name will be listed. In this mode the lifetime and current number of
mails will be shown, too. You can get such a list of all boards with "D B *".

Example:   D B NOS   Lists all boards which include "NOS"

Options:
D -J- B *   shows boards without boardinfo headlines (file "boardinf.bcm")
D -S- B [*] shows boards without subboards
D -C  B [*] shows boards without paging (if paging is activated)

You can also combine each of these options.

              D DL8MBT 1-        shows all mails for DL8MBT

DIR <board> ["<search string>"]
Shows boards which match <search string> (a call, BID or part of the title).
Example:      D TRX "FT470"

You can use options with DIR command, and also define those options as
default. See also HELP ALTER and HELP OPTION DIR

To use an option add "-" before, to switch of add "-" below option letter.
Examples:   D -G   shows only unread mails (option G is activated)
            D -L-  doesn't show lifetime (option L is switched off)
Capital/small letters are not relevant for options, commands, boards, etc.

See also HELP DIR <subcommand>
Subcommands are: AFTER BOARDS MESSAGES NEWS OUTSTANDING PATH SENT USERS
	         HOLD UNKNOWN DESTINATIONS
\\DIR.HOLD
Syntax: D(IR) H(OLD)

Shows all mails with hold flag. Bulletins will show since last check, but last
check date will not be changed. User mails will be shown complete.
\\DIR.HOLDUSERS
Syntax: D(IR) HOLDU(SERS)

Shows all user mails with hold flag.
\\DIR.MESSAGES
Syntax: D(IR) M(ESSAGES) ["<search string>"]

Without a parameter this command lists all mails in the bulletin boards
(very much!). With <search string> all mails which include this will be
listed. Upper-/lower-case letters are of no matter.

Example:   D M "FT470"   Lists all mails in all boards that include
                         "FT470" in the title
\\DIR.NEWS
Syntax: D(IR) N(EWS) ["<search string>"]

Similar to DIR MESSAGES, but only mails which arrived after the last
DIR NEWS will be listed (this works like CHECK).

Example:    D N         shows all new mails since last DIR NEWS or CHECK

            D N MIR     shows all new mails that include "MIR" in the title
\\DIR.OUTSTANDING
Syntax: D(IR) O(UTSTANDING) [ U | I ] [ <boxcall> [<range>] ]

Shows all mails that haven't been forwarded yet. You can reduce output with
range parameter. First there will be user mails shown, after that bulletins.
They are sorted by time of forward.

Example:    D O DB0SFG 1-20
            shows next 20 mails, that will become forwarded to DB0FSG next

Instead of <boxcall> you can also use a mail type. With "D O U" only user
mails, with "D O I" only bulletins are shown. With "d o" all outstanding
mails to all S&F partners are shown.
\\DIR.PATH
Syntax: D(IR) P(ATH) [<boxcall>]

Lists S&F partners and the parameters from "fwd.bcm".
Example:    D P           shows all S&F partners with parameters
            D P <boxcall> shows only the parameters of one S&F partner
\\DIR.SENT
Syntax: D(IR) S(ENT)

Lists all mails in which your own call occures. So only mails that have been
send by yourself and mails having your call in the title will be listed.
\\DIR.UNKNOWN
Syntax: D(IR) U(NKNOWN)

Shows all user mails with MYBBS not set to this BBS.

Shortform:   D -N -H -E -V- -Q- U M
\\DIR.USERS
Syntax(1): D(IR) U(SERS)

Lists all user, who have at least one mail (also deleted).
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Syntax(2): D(IR) U(SERS) A(LL) [<call>]

Without <call> all known users are listes (can be very much!). There can be
a call or a fragment of a call specified, then only users will be displayed
who have this call or fragment in their call.

Example:   D U A GB   Lists all users who have "GB" in their call.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Syntax(3): D(IR) U(SERS) L(OCAL) [<call>]

Lists all users, who logged on at least one time. The rest is like D U A.

Example:   D U L SP   Lists all users who have "SP" in their call and have
                      logged on at least one time.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Syntax(4): D(IR) U(SERS) M(SG) [<text>]

Lists all user mails who have <text> in the call or title.

Example:   D U M BAYCOM            Lists the mails of all user which include
                                   "BAYCOM" in the title.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Syntax(5): D -N User Msg

Shows all user mails from users who have NOT specified this BBS as their
MYBBS. So you can find the mails which are not forwarded.

Example:   D -N U M
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

See also HELP OPTION DIR
\\DISABLE
(only sysop, init.bcm)
Syntax: DIS(ABLE)

The disable state is written in "init.bcm" as "disable 1". BBS is disabled for
further logins and S&F. If sysop do critical things in BBS he can disable BBS
for others. Only sysop can connect to BBS, if BBS is disabled (after input of
pw). Every login a message "BBS is closed" is shown. User which are
connected to BBS before DISABLE command must be killed manually by sysop with
KILL command (search task number with PS command before). If MYCALL and
BOXADDRESS of BBS is not defined, BBS become disabled at startup time
automatically.

See also HELP ENABLE
\\DOSINPUT
(only sysop, init.bcm, only DOS)
Syntax: DOSINPUT [ 0 | 1 ]

Defines execution of DOS command.

DOSINPUT 0
   As usual DOS command system calls can only write to standard output (no
   direct screen output). Command isn't allowed to wait for ANY user input.
   If a program waits for user input, BBS watchdog will hopeful reset PC
   and reboot.

DOSINPUT 1
   User input for dos commands are allowed. If DOSINPUT is set to 1, it's
   possible to use "o time". So it's recommented to use this setting for
   remote sysop. If DOSINPUT ist set to 1, the use of SHROOM is impossible.

SHROOM is a program which swaps memory used by BCM to harddisk, while
oshell command is executed. So more memory is available for oshell command.
\\DOSPREEXEC
(sysop, only DOS, option _PREPOSTEXEC in config.h)
Syntax: dospreexec [ OFF | <Befehl> ]
(Default: OFF)

Use an external watchdog. If you use "shroom" when doing an oshell command,
the internal watchdog is switched off. Therefore you can use an external
watchdog, e.g. AUTOBOOT
  ftp://ftp.gu.net/pub/dos/fido/robots/autoboot.zip

Example:
  autoexec.bat:
    autoboot /sit 600 /alr 580 /fos 0
  init.bcm:
    dospreexec autoboot /dos 0 >nul
    dospostexec autoboot /dos 1 >nul

The command doesn't suppress the output, so if you don't like an output add
">nul" at the end of the command or you can transfer the output to a logfile,
e.g. with "> c:\watchdog.log".

See also HELP DOSPOSTEXEC
\\DOSPOSTEXEC
(sysop, only DOS, option _PREPOSTEXEC in config.h)
Syntax: dospostexec [ OFF | <Befehl> ]
(Default: OFF)

Use an external watchdog.

See also HELP DOSPREEXEC
\\E=ERASE
\\EDIT
(only sysop, only DOS)
Syntax: ED(IT) <filename>

EDIT executes internal editor. It's a small editor which can handle up to
60 kByte text files. To use that editor it's necessary that there are 60 kByte
free memory available. The editor can be used with normal cursor keys.

Special functions:
  CTRL-Y     delete a line
  CTRL-F     search for string
  CTRL-L     search again
  CTRL-N     jump to line
  ESC        quit editor (with or without saving)
\\ENABLE
(only sysop)
Syntax: EN(ABLE)
The enable state is written in "init.bcm" as "disable 0". To enable the BBS
from disable state.

See also HELP DISABLE
\\ENDE=QUIT
\\ERASE
Syntax: E(RASE) [<board>] [<range>]

Erases the mails specified with <range> in <board>. If you do not specify a
board, the mails in the last used board will be erased. If you do not specify
a range, the last read mail will be erased.

Examples:   E DL8MBT 3-4   erases mails 3-4 from DL8MBT
            E 1            erases mail 1 of the current board

You are only allowed to erase own mails you send or if they are for your call.
With ERASE a mail will only be marked as erased. Using UNERASE you can unmark
this mail. With the command PURGE mails will really be erased. If a mail is
erased with the ERASE command, the numbers of the other mails will not change.
\\ERASELOG
(only sysop, init.bcm)
Syntax: ERASEL(OG) [<n>]

This parameter defines if erase of mails will be logged in file
"trace/eraselog.bcm". Following options are possible:
Value Flag    Discription
  1   #L      remote erase mail received, and sender BBS is same as sender BBS
              of original mail
      #X      remote erase mail received, but sender BBS is not the same
      #K      remote erase mail send by this BBS
  2   #S      erased mails local from sysop
  4   #E      erased mails local from user
  8   #F      forwarded user mails
 16   #U      logging of unerase commands
 32   #T      erased bulletin because of transfer
 64   #W      worked WP mail as received

The parameter <n> can be calculated as amount of all all desired options.

Example:
      ERASELOG 0   ... nothing is logged
      ERASELOG 127 ... all erase commands are logged

If option "+V" is set at DIR or LIST command, erased mails are also shown.
Instead of ")" after number there is above flag shown.
\\ERLOG
Syntax: ERL(OG) ["<search string>"]

Shows last 2 kBytes of file "trace/eraselog.bcm" where all erase commands are
logged. If you add a <search string>, all lines containing that string are
shown. The use of " " is only needed if <search string> should contain spaces.
The <search string> can also be a special date or call.
\\EXIT
Syntax: EX(IT)

Connection with BBS will be closed and new QUIT date will be set.
Running outputs will be finished before disconnect.
\\EXPORT
(only sysop)
Syntax: EXP(ORT) [-a] [-b] [-u] <filename> <command>

All output of BBS command <command> are saved to file <filename>.

Example:   export ibm.txt r ibm 120-140
           export text d dl8mbt 1-

 -a  output will be add to an existing file, without option "-a" the existing
     file will be overwriten without further note
 -b  will do a transparent output (only needed under DOS)
 -u  command is executed by user not sysop, this is important for runutils.

Example:   EXPORT -a test.txt ps
           EXPORT -u server.txt ps -abs

This command can also be used to prevent output of commands.

Example:   EXPORT NUL OS blabla.exe
\\EXTRACT
(only sysop, option DF3VI_EXTRACT in config.h)
Syntax: EXTRACT [<boardname>] [<range>]

Extract can be used to save BIN and 7PLUS files from mails. The files are
saved in TEMP directory of BCM ("/bcm/temp"). BIN and 7PLUS files will be
overwritten merciless! If a BIN filename is missing, a new one will be
created. Go/Stop marks of 7plus files are not saved. Existing files are not
replaced but their extension will count up.
\\F=FORWARD
\\F>
Switch to S&F mode.
\\FEDIT
(only sysop, only DOS)
Syntax: FE(DIT)

Shortcommand. The same as "EDIT FWD.BCM". Don't forget to do a "NEW" after
editing to active your changes.

See also HELP FWDEDIT
\\FILESERVER=FS
\\FILESURF=FS
\\FIND=PATH
\\FINGER=USERS
\\FLEXNET
Flexnet is a well known node and digi software implemented by Gunter Jost,
DK7WJ. Since 1989 Flexnet was ported to RMNC hardware. Since 1991 a DOS
version of Flexnet exists which is developed since 1994 in addition with
DL8MBT. PC/Flexnet consist of a modular driver concept and it's freely
configurable. The current version of PC/Flexnet is v3.3h (16.11.1999).

See also HELP FLEXNET CMD (user commands of Flexnet)
\\FLEXNET.AKTUELL
Information about new news around digi are shown. These information are saved
in file "a.fpr".
\\FLEXNET.BCM
Connection between BCM and PC/Flexnet.

a) BBS and digi on same computer:
BCM BBS is connected internal via port 15 from PC/Flexnet with digi.
Parameters are: MODE 15 y       - automatic sysop
                P T 0 15        - set TXDelay to zero (internal link!)
                P S 15 15       - add an SSID (e.g. 15)
                L 15 <call>-8 @ - add BBS link entry
At BBS the parameter MYCALL must be set: MYCALL <call>-8

b) BBS and digi on different computers:
At BBS computer the channel mode (MODE, PARMS) must be set with FSET command.
Example:        FSET MODE 0 19200c     - CRC-KISS with 19k2 baud
                FSET TXD  0 1          - TxDelay is set to 10 ms
At digi computer you set:
                MODE 7 19200c          - CRC-KISS with 19k2 baud
                P T 1 0                - TxDelay is set to 10 ms
                P S 5 5                - add an SSID (e.g. 5)
                L 5 DB0ABC-8 @         - add BBS link entry
The link should be added with "L <port> <call>-8 @" at digi computer.
Note: add your local digi as via entry to your "fwd.bcm" at each path
you set, e.g.: "...AA <target> <local digi>".
\\FLEXNET.BEACONS
The command BEACON defines the configuration of mailbeacon of PC/Flexnet
digi. This information is saved in file "b.fpr".

There are some rules for "b.fpr":
- on all links there can be so much beacons defined as you like
- every beacon line has following structure:
  <min> <port> <tocall [via <call> [<call>...]]> : <text> #

  "#"      divides different beacon information
  <min>    is the time in minutes between two beacon transmissions
           (range: 0...255 [min]; 0 means no beacon)
  <port>   is the channel where the beacon should transmitted
  <tocall> is the target call of the beacon, e.g. "BEACON", "RMNC",
           "FLXNET","TEST" or others
  via      there may be defined up to 8 digipeaters over which the beacon
           should be transmitted

  Example:   #10 0 FLEX:Digi Homburg - JN39PJ - Homburg/Hoecherberg - R 61
             #30 1 FLEX DB0DIG DB0HOM:Interlink DB0HOM-DB0DIG QRV
             #5 0
             FLXNET:Testbake.... DB0xxx

  The above example transmits three beacons, which are divided through
  "#" char (bake1...#...bake2...#...bake3).

- between the single beacons you can use carriage returns (CR) for
  better overview of file
- it makes sense to put the "#" chars (as in example) at beginning of
  lines, then beacons have a CR at their end
- capital/small letters don't worry for call
- the sender call of each beacon is everytime the MYCALL of digi
- if there is no beacon defined, digi sends each three minutes a default
  beacon on user channel (SSID 0)
\\FLEXNET.CMD
Command overview Flexnet (user commands):

\\FLEXNET.LINK
(only sysop)
LINK < ch | call | - > <call> [ # | $ | - | @ | > | ) | ! ]

The definition of link partners can be done with LINK command. You can also
define SSID for each link.

The single options are:
a) simple links without routing tests:
  "$" - no routing tests
  "#" - no routing tests; link entry is invisible for normal users
        (e.g. connection of terminal for service purpose)
b) links with routing tests:
  " " - no option: normal routing tests with exchange of routing
        information (default)
  "-" - link partner is only local defined and is not transmitted
        to other link partners, but the targets of subnet behind
        (neighbours) are exchanged to others (e.g. for test purpose)
  ">" - the link partner and all targets of subnet behind aren't
        transmitted to others (e.g. internal net)
  "!" - the link partner himself is transmitted to others, but
        targets of subnet behind not
  "@" - simple routing test for links to neighbours without flexnet
        routing protocol (e.g. TheNet digis)
  ")" - neighbour with subnet; link entry is invisible for normal
        user (=combination from ">" and "#")

Examples:  1) "link 2 db0dig"      : sets link partner DB0DIG to channel 2
           2) "link 6 df2vo-7 #"   : sets invisible test link
                                     DF2VO-7 to channel 6
           3) "link 15 db0hom-9 )" : sets invisible S&F-SSID "-9"
                                     for BBS DB0HOM to channel 15
           4) "link db0dig db0psc" : sets link DB0PSC via link DB0DIG

In difference to baycom node there can be more than one link defined to a call
on different ports.
To delete a link entry use LINK - <call>. Between flexnet partners normally no
SSID is defined, so the range from 0 to 15 can be used.
\\FLEXNET.LOCAL

If you connect directly to digi, a local connect text is shown in addition to
normal connect text. This text can also be shown with command LO(CAL). The
content is save as "l.fpr".
\\FLEXNET.MHEARD
MHeard <call> [ port | n ]

The MHeard listings contains all heard calls. This listing is saved by digi
automatically all 10 minutes in file "mh.fpr". If this file is missing, the
digi will create a new one.
\\FLEXNET.MODE
(only sysop)
MODE <channel> <mode>

You can define speed and channel options with MODE command of each single
channel. Speed can be a multiplier of 300 Bit/s; the following two 0 must
not be added.

channel mode options are:
 <num>- speed (only valid with internal tact)
  "c" - with CRC-KISS or software-DCD (e.g. SCC cards, baycom modem)
  "d" - fullduplex channel (default: halfduplex)
  "m" - DAMA master
  "r" - external, hardware receive tact (e.g. G3RUH modem)
  "s" - channel synchronisation (e.g. two channels on one frequency)
  "t" - external, hardware send tact (e.g. G3RUH modem)
  "u" - user channel (txdelay measurement, DAMA master)
  "y" - auto-sysop (every time sysop without password)
  "z" - NRZ code (e.g. DF9IC modem), in other case NRZI
  "-" - switch of this channel
  "." - dummy, if no other parameter is needed

Examples:  1) "mode 2 12cmu" : 1200-Bit/s user channel with serial
                               BayCom modem and DAMA mode on channel 2
           2) "mode 3 96dtrz": 9600-Bit/s fullduplex with DF9IC-FSK
                               modem at channel 3
           3) "mode 4 -"     : switch off channel 4 (is not working
                               with every driver!)

The accurate function of each parameter depends on driver, not every driver
supports all parameters.
\\FLEXNET.PARMS
(only sysop)
PARMS <param> <..> <..>

With PARMS command you can define txdelay and SSID of a channel.

a) To setup txdelay at channel <port>:
   Syntax:       P T <txdelay> <port>
   Range:        1...255 [ 10 msec steps ]
   Example:      P T 12 3    means a txdelay of 120ms at port 3

b) To setup a SSID at channel <port>:
   Syntax:       P S <ssid> [ port | 16 ]
   Range:        must be in range of set MYCALL SSID range
   Example:      P S 15 15

   You can delete a defined SSID if you set it to (not existent) channel
   16: P I <ssid> 16

   If a channel has not a defined SSID, only connects of link partner
   are allows. For testing purpose it's better to define for each channel
   a SSID, and only delete SSID if port should have only one
   exclusive link.
\\FLEXNET.PW
Syntax: PW
Starts string query for flexnet sysop password with TheNet/BayCom password
procedure.
\\FLEXNET.RESET
(only sysop)
This command is not implemented at PC/Flexnet. You can use "shutdown -r" at
BBS DOS command prompt or - if flexnet is running on a different computer
"reset" with help of SERV.
\\FLEXNET.RESTART=FLEXNET.RESET
\\FLEXNET.SETSEARCH
You can search a usercall (FIND command) on all digis or ports sysop defines
in setsearch file. This file is saved as "s.fpr" in flexnet directory and
has following format:

   <call1>
   <call1> [<call2> [<call3> [<call4> [<call5>]]]]

Example of a "s.fpr" file:      search paths for FIND command
                                DB0HOM
                                DB0HOM-2
                                DB0DIG via DB0HOM
                                DB0ZDF via DB0ODW

First links in above exmaple defines the own digi (userport with SSID 0).
Second line defines that search is executed also on channel with SSID -2
(e.g. second userport). Third line shows how you can setup an entry to
neighbour digi DB0DIG. You can also define a search path to a not
directly connectable digi. DB0ZDF can not be connected in above example
from DB0HOM via flexnet autorouter but via DB0ODW.

- if you want to search on channels with different SSID, you have to add them
  as separate entries (like "DB0HOM-2" or "-2" in following examples).

- instead of own MYCALL you can use "-"

  Example (same like above):    search paths for FIND command
                                -
                                -2
                                DB0DIG -
                                DB0ZDF via DB0ODW

TRace <port> [call] [Opt.] trace channel <port>; if you want to trace only
                           one call, add this call as parameter
TRace                      terminate trace mode
WRITE <A|B|C|H|I|L|S>      writes textfile (terminate with /ex or ^Z)

The overview of user commands are shown with HELP FLEXNET CMD.

The connection between BCM and Flexnet is discribed in HELP FLEXNET BCM.
\\FLEXNET.TRACE
(only sysop)

TR(ACE) <port> <call> [options]

All received and sent data of one flexnet channel are shown. This runs only if
monitor of BBS is not active. Data with compressed headers are not shown.

Options are:
 '#' - suppress RR/RNR/REJ frames
 '$' - suppress contents of infoframes
 '>' - shows only sent frames
 '<' - shows only received frames
 '*' - shows Tx-Delay (Rx/Tx) of every frame

Command "TRACE" without any parameters will close tracemode.
\\FLEXNET.WRITE
(only sysop)

WRITE <Flex-File>

Writes a textfile to harddisk. Input can be saved with ^Z or /EX.

<Flex-File> = A, B, C, H, I, L, S

The file will be saved in flexnet directory as e.g. "a.fpr". It's better to
send those files via BCM with WT or WPRG command.

a) The texfiles "a.fpr", "c.fpr", "h.fpr", "i.fpr" and "l.fpr" can contain
   any kind of text, there are no rules for these files. But it should be
   necessary that every file (not "c.fpr") begins with a carriage return
   (CR), so that there output is always shown on a new line.
   At the end of each file there should be no CR.
b) The files "b.fpr" and "s.fpr" have a special format, look at
   HELP FLEXNET BEACONS and HELP FLEXNET SETSEARCH.

\\FOLLOWUP=COMMENT
\\FORWARD
Syntax: F(ORWARD) [-F] [-H] <board> <range> [@]<target address>

Mails stored in the BBS can be transfered to an other BBS or an other
distribution address with the FORWARD command. The command is only available
for selfwritten mails or mails addressed to the own callsign.

The address of the mail will not be changed. It only will be forwarded to
the specified target address. If the option "-F" is specified, the address
of the mail will be changed.

S&F is only working with mails without forward hold flag set. To forward such
a mail, use option "-h".

Examples:   F INFO 5 DL                Forwards mail 5 in the board <INFO>
                                       to address @DL.
            F -F DL8MBT 3-4 @ DB0RGB   Forwards mails 3-4 of DL8MBT to
                                       DB0RGB and changes the address.

See HELP ADDRESS, HELP USERSF and HELP OPTION FORWARD
\\FS
Starts filesurf if enabled by sysop. Filesurf is a good possibility to
exchange files.

- "FS" switch from BBS mode to filesurf mode
- "DIR" lists files, you can change directory with "CD"
- to read files use "GET", "DGET", "BGET" and "YGET"
- to exit filesurf mode and return to BBS mode use "BYE", "EXIT" or "QUIT"

You have also the possiblity to remain in BBS mode but then you have to type
every command with leading FS command.
Example:  FS DIR    lists the main directory of filesurf

Commands can be shortened, so far as they are unique. Upper/lower case writing
of commands do not care. Instead of HELP you can use MAN or "?". BCM is an
abbreviation for BayCom-Mailbox.
\\HOLD
(only sysop)
Syntax: HOLD [-u] <range>

Sets defined mail to HOLD (no S&F). You can release held mails with the
option "-u". You can list hold messages with DIR HOLD.

Note: This command is usally nonsens. Better use hold actions in "reject.bcm".
To release mails from held status, the option "-u" is a good choice. Mails
can also be released with "forward -h" command.

See also HELP HOLDTIME, HELP DIR HOLD and HELP REJECT
\\HOLDTIME
(only sysop, init.bcm)
Syntax: HOLDT(IME) [<hours>]
(default: 0)

With parameter HOLDTIME you can define the time in hours for mails which meet
hold criteria (H, F, L or P) in "reject.bcm". You can list hold messages with
DIR HOLD and release held messages with "hold -u" command.

A value of "0" disables the hold mechanism, a value of "48" (means 2 days) is
mostly a good choice.

Note: mails from sysops are always not set on hold by "reject.bcm"!

See also HELP REJECT, HELP DIR HOLD and HELP HOLD
\\HTTP
In contrast to most other solutions (e.g. CGI scripts) BCM uses a build in
HTTP server. That's why BCM HTTP interface can handle any kind of command
interactive. That means that commands are executed directly and users can
login with their own call. The HTTP server can be reached normally via
port 8080. Sysops can setup other ports if they want (see HELP HTTP_PORT).

At first connection with BCM HTTP interface the user gets a window
where login call and password must be entered.
Follow these rules:
- login call is every time your own call.
- password must be entered as following:
   * if you connect via localhost [127.0.0.1] or via packet radio network then
     password is same as your name known by BBS. So sysop must not setup a
     password for each user. If a user has entered a user password, login via
     HTTP is impossible.
   * if you connect from other networks then password is your set TTY
     password (see HELP ALTER TTYPW)

After successful login the BCM HTTP server sets a little cookie at users
webbrowser. The cookie is used to identify the user for later logins and so to
bypass login query. If webbrowser is forbidden to save a cookie, user have to
login with his user call and password each time he uses BCM HTTP server again.

The webbrowser must support frames; netscape products are a good choice.

All functions of BCM can be done via HTTP interface, but there
are some restrictions:
- if sending mails you have to add reference everytime. It's not working to
  write a send command in command line and then to click on execute
- you can't use interactive runutils
- if you read mails with binary content, the content is converted
  automatically (e.g. JPG pictures)

All other functions should work as normal. See also HELP HTTPNEWBIE
\\HTTP_PORT
(only sysop, init.bcm)
Syntax: HT(TP_PORT) [<n>]
(default: 8080)

Defines port number of BCM HTTP server. 0 switches the port off.
Example: HTTP_PORT 8080

See also HELP PORTNUMBER and HELP HTTP
\\HTTPACCOUNT
(only sysop, init.bcm, only Linux/Win32)
Syntax: HTTPACCOUNT [ 0 | 1 ]
(default: 0)

If HTTPACCOUNT is set to "1", the function "create account" is enabled,
if guestcall ist set, you login with this guestcall and your ip-number
is not equal to "44.xx". If this feature is enabled, the guestcall can
create once a ttypw password for a callsign, if the password for this
callsign is not set before.

The default value is "0" and must not changed until the sysop wants this
special feature enabled.

See also HELP GUESTCALL
\\HTTPGUESTFIRST
(only sysop, init.bcm, only Linux/Win32)
Syntax: HTTPGUESTFIRST [ 0 | 1 ]
(default: 0)

If HTTPGUESTFIRST is set to "1" and sysop defined the guestcall, all
http access is automatic done as user "guestcall". This user has only
read access to the mailbox. The function "userlogin" is shown and creates
the possibility to login with another callsign.

The default value is "0" and must not changed until the sysop wants this
special feature enabled.

See also HELP GUESTCALL
\\HTTPLOG
Syntax: HTTPL(OG) ["<search string>"]

Shows all lines of file "trace/httplog.bcm" which contains the search
string. You must only use " " if <search string> should contain spaces.
If you don't add <search string> the last 2 kBytes of the file are shown.
The <search string> can be a date or call.

\\HTTPSHOWSYSOPCALL
(Sysop, init.bcm, only Linux/Win32)
Syntax: HTTPSHOWSYSOPCALL [ 0 | 1 ]
(default: 1)

If HTTPSHOWSYSOPCALL is set to "1", a guest can send a mail to sysop via
http webinterface without knowing the sysop callsign. This can allow a SPAM
robot to send a lot of spam mails to sysop.
If the value is set to "0", the guest must input the sysop callsign to send
a message to sysop.
\\HTTPROBOTS
(only sysop, init.bcm, only Linux/Win32)
Syntax: HTTPROBOTS [ 0 | 1 ]
(default: 1)

If HTTPROBOTS is set to "1", a webrobots like googlebot is allowed to index
the complete mailbox via HTTP-Access. If set to "0", the robot is not
allowed, to index the mailbox.
\\HTTPTTYPW
(only sysop, init.bcm, only Linux/Win32)
Syntax: HTTPTTYPW [ 0 | 1 ]
(default: 0)

If HTTPTTYPW is set to "1", only the ttypw password is valid for http
access (also via amprnet!). You can use this feature to gain a
password authorisation for the pw&hold mechanism, see also HELP REJECT.

The default value is "0" and must not changed until the sysop wants this
special feature enabled.
\\I=INFO
\\IMPDEL
If you use IMPDEL inside an importfile. The importfile will be deleted after
execution. This command must not be placed only at end of importfile.
\\IMPORT
(only sysop)
Syntax: IMPO(RT) <filename>

All content of <filename> is interpreted as command via console or as received
via air. You can execute every BBS command from such an import file.
Especially useful for implicit send commands.

Example: File STAT.IMP

s statisti @ db0aab # 30 log statistics
This is the statistic.
nnnn                                     (end of file)

IMPORT stat                         (".imp" isn't needed)

You can use import inside of import files, too. The new import
will be executed at same time as new task, so this shouldn't
lead to failures.

Import doesn't know semicolon ";" as division between two commands.
So only one command per line is possible. If import is started while
SENDLOCK is active (e.g. REORG), the execution of import is done
later. If import can't execute a SEND command the execution of import
is aborted and an entry is added to SYSLOG.

See also HELP STATUS SEMAPHORES and HELP IMPDEL
\\INFO
Syntax: I(NFO)

Shows an info text about the BBS. At beginning a summary of BBS parameters are
shown, after that a file info.<language> is shown which can be edited by
sysop.
\\INFOLIFE
(only sysop, init.bcm)
Syntax: INFOL(IFE) [<days>]
(default: 999)

Sets default lifetime of bulletin boards which aren't defined in
"bulletin.bcm". These boards become subboards of TMP board. Subboards of TMP
disappear if all their mails are deleted. If user set a lifetime for his
mails, lifetime is limited to the value set by sysop.

INFOLIFE should not have a great value otherwise a lot of TMP subboards are
created. If you don't care about that and if you have enough harddisk space
you can set INFOLIFE to 999 (no deletion anyway).
\\INFOPATH
(only sysop, init.bcm)
Syntax: INFOP(ATH) [<directory>]
(default: "/bcm/info/")

Sets path where bulletins are stored. Default value is subdirectory "info" of
BCM directory. INFOPATH may be set to another drive (DOS) or other
directories. Instead of backslash "\" a slash "/" is used (important for
runutils)!

Example: infopath d:/info

Running DOS it makes sense to set INFOPATH to a single drive, because DOS
filesystem FAT16 uses clustersize for each file as following:
              partition size    cluster size
       ----------------------------------------
       partition until 256 MB    4 kBytes
               256  -  512 MB    8 kBytes
               512  - 1024 MB   16 kBytes
              1024  - 2048 MB   32 kBytes
              2048  - 4096 MB   64 kBytes
So each mail uses at partion size of 2.5 GigaBytes minimum 64 kBytes! Even
with 450 MB partion size a cluster size of 8 kBytes is used. With 8 kBytes
less than 50% of size is used for storing real data. That's a lot of overhead
and unused harddisk size. So it makes sense to use a single system, a single
user and a single info drive.

INFOPATH can be also set to a network drive. This is perhaps a trick to use
other filesystems (novell, ext2fs, winnt) running dos. Another trick is to use
FAT32 filesystem, but there are some problem with newer DOS version and DOS
command prompt of BCM reported. Try it!

Running Linux you should select an ext2fs partition with 1 or 2 kByte inode
size.
\\INPUT
The input will be closed with return or enter key. There may be more than one
command at one line, when they are separated between semicolon.

Example:   UNERASE 3-4;r 3-4

Output can be stopped with entry of a empty line. Output of binary files can
not be stopped.
If BBS receive unknown command lines, BBS will close connection (like BYE).
\\INTERNETMAILGATE
(only sysop, init.bcm, only Linux/Win32, option INETMAILGATE in config.h)
Syntax: INTERNETMAILGATE [ <CALL> | off ]
(default: off)

If <CALL> is defined and an email is received via SMTP interface, following
will happen:

- the sender email address will be converted in the lokal adress <CALL>
  (e.g. meier@darc.de -> DB0ABC if "internetmailgate db0abc" is defined)
- the original sender email address will be added to the subject of the mail
  (e.g. "meier@darc.de - blabla" will be the subject)
- the receiver email address will be truncated to the receiver callsign
  (e.g. db1abc@db0abc.de -> DB1ABC)

Hint: The Home-BBS of <CALL> should be the own mailbox!
\\K=HEADER
\\KILL
(only sysop)
Syntax: KI(LL) <task number>

Kill a process inside BBS. This is working for all running tasks. You can get
the task number with PS command. It makes sense to use this command to kill
unwanted BBS logins (e.g. sysop is doing urgent service remotes routines and
has disabled the BBS and wants to kill the last logged-in users before
disabling). The user gets a disconnect after being killed. If processes like
"desktop", "logind", "forwardd" etc are killed, the sysop is responsible for
consequences.
Sysops who don't know what they are doing, should NOT use kill command!
\\L=LIST
\\L2INFO
(only Linux/Win32)
Syntax: L2INFO

Shows information about layer2 parameters of connected ports.
\\LANGUAGE=ALTER.SPEECH
\\LF=ALTER.LF
\\LIFETIME
(only sysop)
Syntax: LIF(ETIME) <board> <maximum LT> [<minimum LT>]

The lifetime shows how long a mail stays in the BBS before it is deleted
automatically. The lifetime of each bulletinboard is set by the BBS sysop.
The lifetime of all userboards is the same, but it can be changed by the
user.

Maximum value is 999 days (never purged), minimum can be 1 day.
All lifetimes of boards are being saved in file "bulletin.bcm".
If a user selects a lifetime for his own mails, the value is limited
to <maximum LT> parameter. Sysops can break the limitation in any case.
If a second lifetime <minimum LT> is added the mails are being purged
after <minimum LT> days. The default value of <minimum LT> is 1.

Examples:
LIFETIME BAYCOM 360 180     mails are being purge minimal after 180 days,
                            maximum after 360 days if mail was set with a user
                            lifetime; mails without any lifetime set by user
                            are being purged after 360 days

LIFETIME BAYCOM 999 999     mails aren't being purged in any case and all
                            mails are set to LT 999

LIFETIME BAYCOM   3   3     mails are being purged after 3 days in any case.
\\LINEFEED=ALTER.LF
\\LIST
Syntax: L(IST) [<board>] [<range>] [ [<] <search string> ]

Similar to DIR (but less powerful), gives a list in Thebox format. The default
options of this command are different to the ones of DIR.

Examples:
L DL8MBT 1-                   shows all mails of DL8MBT
L BAYCOM -10                  shows the newest 10 mails of board BAYCOM

See HELP ALTER ILIST, HELP ALTER ULIST and HELP OPTION LIST
\\LO=LOG
\\LOG
Syntax: LO(G) [-options] [<date>] [<search string>]

Shows the log of the specified day or searches for <search string> which can
be a call or a date. There only will be shown the newest 20 entries.

The following options can be used:
  -f   ALSO shows entries of S&F-connects
  -s   ONLY shows sysop-logins
  -w   shows the entries of one week (7 days)
  -m   shows the entries of on month (30 days)
  -q   shows the entries of three months (90 days)
  -y   shows the entries of one year
       (Attention: m, q and y will take a very long time!)
  -c   only counts the number of logins
  -a   shows ALL found entries (not only 20)
The options can be combined.

The entries will be displayed like this:
TxBytes: Bytes sent to the user (or BBS)
RxBytes: Bytes received from the user
CPUsec:  used CPU-time
F:       Flag, meaning: S=sysop, Q=logoff with QUIT, F=S&F connect
TXFi:    Number of files sent by the BBS
RXFi:    Number of files sent to the BBS

LOG <call>          shows the today's log of <call>     e.g. LOG DG3RBU
LOG <date> <call>   shows the log of <call> on <date>   e.g. LOG 27. DG3RBU
LOG <date>          shows log of the specified day      e.g. LOG 08.09.92

See also HELP LOG EXAMPLE and HELP OPTION LOG
\\LOG.EXAMPLE
Example of a log entry:
Log entries (max 20) 15.12.92:

See also HELP LOG and HELP OPTION LOG
\\LOGBOOK=LOG
\\LOGIN
(only sysop)
Syntax: LOGI(N) <call>

Sysops can be loggedin with <call>. This is needed to simulate a user login
for testing purpose, to setup parameters for that call, or to look at
connection text for that call etc.
\\LOGINCALLFORMAT
(only sysop, init.bcm, option _LCF in config.h)
Syntax: LOGINCallformat [ 0 | 1 | 2 ]
(default: 0)

0 = ham radio callsign only allowed
1 = citizen band callsign only allowed
2 = both
\\LOGOUT=EXIT
\\LT=SETLIFE
\\LTQUERY
(only sysop, init.bcm)
Syntax: LTQUERY [ 0 | 1 | 2 ]
(default: 0)

0: no lifetime query
1: lifetime query only for bulletin mails
2: lifetime query for bulletin and personal mails

If LTQUERY is set to 1 or 2, lifetime must be added when sending mails.
If no lifetime is included with SEND command, lifetime is asked. If LTQUERY
is set to 0, the query is disabled.
\\M=MSG
\\M_FILTER
(only sysop, init.bcm)
Syntax: M_(FILTER) [ <program> | off ]
(default: off)

With M_FILTER a program can be defined in file "init.bcm" which is executed
each time a mail is received. If value is set to "off" this function is
disabled.

This program can examine the mail, e.g. forbidden words etc. The program
must return a value after examining the mail. It depends on the value what
happens with the mail:
  0: nothing happens
  1: the mail will be deleted
  2: the mail is being hold

The return values 1 and 2 are only available using DOS or Windows, not Linux!
So, when using Linux, M_FILTER can only be used to call an external program
without evaluating a return value.

Note: The <program> must contain the whole path!

All M_FILTER calls are logged in file "trace\m_filter.bcm".
\\MACRO
(only sysop, Linux/Win32)
Syntax: MAC(RO) [<macro>]

Starts a macro from file "macro.bcm".
\\MACROS
A macro is an abbreviation which can be used in the prompt text, system
messages and in any kind of msg/*.* files. This macro will be expanded to a
curtain information everytime the prompt/file is shown.

The following macros can be used in the prompt (and CTEXT/CNEW/INFO):
  %a   used CPU capacity of the BBS (in the last 40 seconds)
  %b   current boardname
  %c   call of the user
  %d   current date
  %e   new mails count since last CHECK/DIR NEWS
  %f   free blocks
  %h   the user's helplevel
  %i   login time
  %j   sysop/user prompt
  %k   amount of bulletin mails in BBS
  %l   last login (date and time)
  %m   call of the BBS
  %n   the user's name
  %o   number of logged-in users
  %p   needed CPU time since the login
  %r   Linefeed (RETURN)
  %s   shows free memory (heap), value is shown in kBytes
  %t   current time
  %u   shows "uptime" of BBS since last reset
  %v   version of the BBS software
  %w   shows read/writen bytes
  %%   the "%"-sign

Examples:   A PR (%b) %c de %m>          creates prompt like Thebox
            (BAYCOM) DL8MBT de DB0AAB>

            A PR [%o/%a%%](%b)-->        shows number of logins and used
            [22/95%](DL8MBT)-->          capacity at the prompt
\\MAILBEACON
(only sysop, init.bcm)
Syntax: MAILBEACON [ 0 | 1 ]
(default: 0)

If the value of MAILBEACON is set to "1", a mailbeacon (file "beachead.bcm")
is send each time. If set to "0", a beacon is only send, if new usermails
are available in the mailbox.

The default value is "0" and must not changed until the sysop wants this
special feature enabled.
\\MAILFLAGS
OpenBCM can handle up to 16 mail flags, at the moment only 6 are used:

1. (Mail-)Type:
   defines mail type
   "A"  Acknoledge mail
   "B"  Bulletin mail

See also HELP OPTIONS READ
\\MAILLISTSERV
(only sysop, init.bcm)
Syntax: MAILLISTS(ERV) [ 0 | 1 | 2 ]
(default: 1)

Mailserver can be configured with this parameter:
maillistserv 0 .. mailserver is inactive
maillistserv 1 .. active
maillistserv 2 .. active, but only sysop can add new mailing groups
\\MAILLISTSENDER
(only sysop, init.bcm, option MAILSERVER in config.h)
Syntax: MAILLISTSENDER [ 0 | 1 ]
(default: 1)

This parameter defines the sender callsign of a mailing list mail. This value
should be set to "1", otherways FBB BBS systems may learn wrong MYBBS from
user which are using the mailing list.

maillistsender 0  the original sender is used as sender for the mailing list
                  mail (use this only if mails do not pass any FBB system)
maillistsender 1  the mailbox callsign is used as sender for the mailing list
                  mail
\\MAILSERVER
Syntax: MAILLISTS <command> <group> [parameter]

The mailserv(er) can be used to deliver one mail to more than one recipient.
If you'll like to send a mail to an existing group send your mail to BBS
call and use as mail title "mailto <group>" and then your subject.

Defines group description. Maximum lenght is 60 letters.
\\MAILSERVER.HELP=MAILSERVER
\\MAILSERVER.INFO
Syntax: MAILS(ERVER) I(NFO) <group>

Shows information about groups. If no group is defined,
an overview over all groups are shown.
\\MAILSERVER.LIST=MAILSERVER.INFO
\\MAILSERVER.NEWGROUP=MAILSERVER.+G
\\MAILSERVER.OPTION
Syntax: MAILS(ERVER) O(PTIONS) <group> [<option>]

Sets group options:
-c            only maintainers are allowed to change calls
-m            only maintainers are allowed to send mails
-u            only user of group are allowed to send mails
(no option)   deletes all existing options of <group>
\\MAILSERVER.RESET
Syntax: MAILS(ERVER) RESET <group>

Sets mailing group counter to back to 1.
\\MAILSERVER.SETNUM
Syntax: MAILS(ERVER) SE(TNUMBER) <group> [<n>]

Sets mailing group counter for next mail to number <n>.
\\MAILSERVER.SUBSCR
Syntax: MAILS(ERVER) SU(BSCRIBE) <group>

Adds own call to existing group.
Another possibility is to send a mail to the BBS where the group exist:
  send <boxcall> subscribe <group>
This adds yourself to that group.

See also HELP MAILSERVER UNSUBSCRIBE
\\MAILSERVER.UNSUBS
Syntax: MAILS(ERVER) U(NSUBSCRIBE) <group>

Removes own call from existing group.
Another possibility is to send a mail to the BBS where the group exist:

See also HELP MAILSERVER SUBSCRIBE
\\MAN
Syntax: MA(N) [<command>]

Same function as HELP or ? <command>.

See also HELP
\\MAXBIDS
(only sysop, init.bcm)
Syntax: MAXB(IDS) [<n>]
(default: 262144)

Parameter MAXBIDS defines maximum number of BIDs stored in BID file after
reorg. BID file is growing automatically around 10000 entries if BBS is
running, after reaching 10000, reorg is executed automatically. The
parameter must be bigger than maximum number of bulletins! It makes sense to
use the default settings. BBS speed is reduced if you select a value that's to
big. You should use a value of 400000 if your computer is not too slow.
\\MAXLOGINS
(only sysop)
Syntax: MAXL(OGINS) [<n>]
(default: 0)

MAXLOGINS limits amount of connects to BBS with same call. There is no
limitation if you set maxlogins 0. If you select maxlogins 1 only one login
per call is allowed (sysops and S&F partner has no limits). You should set
this parameter only to another value then 0 if you have reasons for that
(e.g. CPU to slow). There are no advantages to set this parameter to other
values than 0, because there are no restrictions in BCM soft like in others
(e.g. not enought free channels for connection).
\\MAXPACLEN
(only sysop, init.bcm)
Syntax: MAXPACLEN [<n>]
(default: 255)

The value <n> can be set between MIXPACLEN and 255 and defines the maximum
paclen value a user can set with ALTER PACLEN.

See also HELP MINPACLEN and HELP ALTER PACLEN
\\MD2=MD5
\\MD2SUM
(only sysop)
Syntax: MD2S(UM) [<filename>]

Calculates a MD2 checksum of <filename>.
\\MD5
MD5 is a procedure to calculate a checksum. This checksum is generated from
one fix string (on both ends known) and a string random generated from BBS.
BBS knows password "GEHEIM" and generates the random string "10359". The
user terminal (or S&F partner BBS software) knows also the password "GEHEIM"
and calculates from received string "10359" a md2 checksum from "GEHEIM10359".
The result "5f4...9S" is sent back to BBS. At BBS the same calculation has be
done. If the results are the same, the user password was ok.

See HELP PASSWORD
\\MD5SUM
(only sysop)
Syntax: MD5S(UM) [<filename>]

Calculates a MD5 checksum of <filename>.
\\MEM
Syntax: ME(M)
(only debugging command)

MEM shows current memory usage of task management:
- running number of memory block
- size in bytes (max. 64k possible)
- address (segment paragraph)
- task number (see HELP PS), or 255 if call was not done by a call
- purpose

The output can be sorted by following:
-S = size
-A = address
-T = task number
-N = blockname
IF you don't add an option, output is sorted by block number.

Example: MEM -A
\\MINPACLEN
(only sysop, init.bcm)
Syntax: MINPACLEN <n>
(default: 40)

The value <n> can be set between 40 and MAXPACLEN and defines the minimum
paclen value a user can set with ALTER PACLEN.

See also HELP MAXPACLEN and HELP ALTER PACLEN
\\MKBOARD
(only sysop)
Syntax: MK(BOARD) <mainboard> <subboard>

MKBOARD adds a new boardname. If you want to create a new subboard you have
to add as first parameter the existing mainboard.

Example:   MKBOARD software baycom
           -> creates a new board SOFTWARE/BAYCOM if SOFTWARE
              is existing

If you want to create a new mainboard, you have to add a "/". The space
between "/" and boardname in this case is redundant.

Example:   MKBOARD / SOFTWARE
           -> creates a new board SOFTWARE

The lifetime of new board is same as INFOLIFE. If you want to change it, use
LIFETIME command. File "bulletin.bcm" is updated automatically.
\\MONITOR
(only sysop)
Syntax: MON(ITOR) [-<options>] <task-id>

<options>  -i suppress input (of user)
           -o suppress output (to user)
           -r suppress data content of READ commands
           -d suppress data content of DIR/LIST/CHECK commands
           -s suppress data content of SEND commands

MONITOR shows input and output of any BBS task.

You can monitor other users logins and also forward connects. You can use
monitor command via air remote and from console. To get <task-id> use the
PS command. The command is useful to view output of trace window or monitor
task. Both tasks don't write a CR at end of line (not enough space). You
can max. start one monitor per task. However it's even possible to monitor
a monitor task.
\\MSG=TALK
\\MVBOARD
(only sysop)
Syntax: MV(BOARD) <oldmain> <boardname> <newmain>

MVBOARD moves a subboard to another main boardname. Name of subboard isn't
changed during this procedure.

Example:  MVBOARD tmp c64 computer
          -> moves board c64 from TMP to COMPUTER main boardname

If you want to create a new main boardname from sub boardname, use "/".

Examples: MVBOARD / c64 computer
          -> moves mainboard C64 to COMPUTER/C64

          MVBOARD tmp c64 /
          -> moves board TMP/C64 to C64 main boardname

The contents of the moving board renain unchanged during the moving procedure.
Don't use TRANSFER command in those cases, because it's too slow and you need
a change of boardname. Lifetime of board is set after moving with MVBOARD to
default infolifetime. You have to use LIFETIME command to change it.
\\MYBBS
Syntax: MY(BBS) [<address>]
(You may use NH, A(LTER) F(ORWARD) or A(LTER) M(YBBS) instead)

Sets own home BBS. All mails you get will be forwarded to this address. This
setting will automatically be forwarded to all neighboured BCM and Thebox BBS.
With the option "-L" you can set a local MYBBS (no S&F of MYBBS).
Do not use your own call for MYBBS, also if you using user S&F.

Example:   MYBBS DB0AAB       sets the MYBBS to DB0AAB

See also HELP ALTER FORWARD and HELP FORWARD
\\MYCALL
(only sysop, init.bcm)
Syntax: MYC(ALL) <call1> <call2> [ <call3> <call4> ]

Sets all calls of the BBS. Up to 4 calls can be set. If no call is set, the
call from BOXHEADER is used automatically with SSID 8 for <call1> and 7 for 2.
For outgoing forward the BBS uses <call1> with SSID defined with FWDSSID.
If this SSID is already in use, it will be incremented until unused is found.
The different BBS calls are:
    <call1>   login for user and BBS S&F partners
    <call2>   only for incoming user S&F
    <call3>   2. BBS call (if needed), no S&F (e.g. call of sysop)
    <call4>   3. BBS call (if needed), normal like <call1>

Examples:   "mycall oe3xsr-8" and "fwdssid 5"
             BBS can be connected from users and BBS with "oe3xsr-8", <call2>
             is set from BOXADDRESS with SSID 7 for user S&F outgoing S&F
             connects starts with "oe3xsr-5"

            "mycall oe3xsr-8 oe3xsr-7" and "fwdssid 5"
             BBS can be connected from users and BBS with "oe3xsr-8", user S&F
             with "oe3xsr-7", outgoing S&F connects starts with "oe3xsr-5"
\\N=NEW
\\NAME=ALTER.NAME

\\NEXT
Syntax: N(EXT) [-r]

Displays the next available mail referring to the last mail you have read
with the READ command. If you use NEXT after your login, the first mail in
your directory will be displayed. If you use option "-r" you get the last
mail (reverse).
\\NH=ALTER.FORWARD
\\NNTP
OpenBCM offers a build-in TCP/IP newsserver. You can read and post all
bulletin mails with your favorite TCP/IP newsreader.

Note: because newsreader programs normally not know something like @EU
      you have to define this in the beginning of the titel of your post!

See also HELP NNTP_PORT
\\NNTPLOG
(only Linux/Win32)
Syntax: NNTPL(OG) ["<search string>"]

Shows all lines of file "trace/nntplog.bcm" which contains the search
string. You must only use " " if <search string> should contain spaces.
If you don't add <search string> the last 2 kBytes of the file are shown.
The <search string> can be a date or call.
\\NNTP_PORT
(only sysop, init.bcm)
Syntax: NNTP_P(ORT) [<n>]
(default: 8119)

Defines the port number of the news server. You can disable news server if you
set port to "0".
Example: NNTP_port 8119

See also HELP NNTP and HELP PORTNUMBER
\\NOPOPSMTP
(only sysop, init.bcm, only Linux/Win32)
Syntax: NOPOPSMTP [<n>]
(default: 0)

nopopsmtp 0: before SMTP a POP3 login is awaited
nopopsmtp 1: SMTP without POP3 is accepted

See also HELP SMTP, HELP ALTER UNSECURESMTP and HELP POP3
\\NOPURGE
(only sysop, init.bcm)
Syntax: NOP(URGE) [<n>]
(default: 0)

You can configure purge of mails with parameter "nopurge". <n> may be a
summary of single values.

nopurge 0: all mails (bulletins and usermails) with exceeded lifetime and all
           (since last purge) erased mails are removed; only the sysop
           can prevent purge on userboards with "SETU <call> NOPURGE 0 | 1"

nopurge 1: Purge for bulletins and usermails is completly disabled

nopurge 2: each user can setup himself "ALTER NOPURGE 0 | 1" for his userboard

nopurge 4: no bulletins are purged; erased mails are invisible for users and
           can be unerased everytime.
           usermails are purged if lifetime has exceeded or mail was erased

nopurge 8: no usermails are purged; erased mails are invisible for users and
           can be unerased everytime.
           bulletins are purged if lifetime has exceeded or mail was erased

Example:  nopurge 6
          -> combines nopurge 2 and nopurge 4 and should be the default
             value to be used on systems with enough harddisc space

See also HELP PURGE CMDS, HELP ALTER UNERASE, HELP PURGE and HELP PURGE A
\\NOTE
(only sysop)
Syntax: NO(TE) <text>

must be greater than 1) and begins with "note:".
\\NOUNKNOWNROUTE
(sysop, init.bcm)
Syntax: NOUNKNOWNROUTE [ 0 | 1 ]
(default: 0)

If set to "1" the message is defered, if there is no route for that message.
If set to "0", all messages are accepted.
\\O=OSHELL
\\OBCM=OPENBCM
\\OCP
(only sysop, only Linux/Win32)
Syntax: OCP <source> <target>

Copy files at filesystem.
Example: ocp /bcm/fwd.bcm /bcm/backup/fwd.bcm

See also HELP OMV, HELP ORM and HELP OMD
\\OLDESTBEACON
(only sysop)
Syntax: OLDESTB(EACON) [<days>]
(default: 1)

Defines how long the user call is shown in mail beacon since new mails are
available for that call since his last login. Default value is 1 (means one
day).
\\OLDESTFWD
(only sysop, init.bcm)
Syntax: OLDEST(FWD) [<days>]
(default: 30)

Sets maximum age of bulletins, that can be forwarded. If a bulletin is older
than this value (calculated from mail headerline) the mail doesn't become
forwarded. The default setting is 30 days. A value of 0 makes no sense and
is converted automatically to 999 days.
\\OLDMAILIMPORT
(only sysop)
Syntax: OLDMAILIMPORT [ -q | -r ] <directory>

With this command it's possible to import mailfile of other Baybox systems.
The source is a directory. An import is only done, if the BID of the mail
is unknown.

Options -q and -r are allowed:
-q    more information about importing are shown
-r    after the import a "REORG F" is done automatically. If the option
      -r is used, the "REORG F" is not executed and must be done by the
      sysop manually. If sysop does not execute "REORG F" the new imported
      mail are not shown in DIR/LIST/CHECK. This option makes only sense
      if the sysop is intended to import mails from a lot of directorys
      and doesn't want to wait for REORG executed after each import. So
      in this case the sysop only executes "REORG F" once at the end of
      the import manually.

Example:
oldmail /bcm/db0abc/info/meinung    imports mail from directory
                                    /bcm/db0abc/info/meinung, but only if
                                    the BID of the mail is unknown
\\OLDUMAIL
Syntax: OLDUMAIL [ 0 | 1 ]
(default: 0)

If OLDUMAIL is set to "1", a short info is send to sender if unread mail is
purged because of lifetime.
\\OMD
(only sysop, only Linux/Win32)
Syntax: OMD <path>

Creates a new directory at filesystem.

Note: If a file with same name exists, the file will be deleted
      and the directory is created!

Example: omd c:\bcm\test\neu\abc

See also HELP OCP, HELP OMV und ORM
\\OMV
(only sysop, only Linux/Win32)
Syntax: OMV <source> <target>

Moves a file at filesystem from <source> to <target>.

Internally the file was copied before and then removed. If copy routine
fails, the file is lost!

See also HELP OCP, HELP ORM und OMD
\\OPENBCM
OpenBCM is the name of Open"BCM". This projekt is born in autum 2002 from
BCM project. The addition "Open" should symbolize the opening of the
project. Everybody who wants to add features in source code is welcome!

  -b<bytes>  maximum size of forward mails ( > 10k)
  -d         (delay) S&F only at set times of "crontab.bcm"
  -e         send E/M files with 4 lines in 1 frame (e.g. DB0SAO)
  -f         send empty line before start S&F (e.g. xNOS)
  -i         BoxBin mails are forwarded regardless of the capabilites of
             the receiving system (not useful in most cases)
  -k         no forward of autobin bulletins
  -l         no forward of autobin user mails
  -m         no forward of 7plus bulletins

  -s         SID is send immediately of connected BBS
  -t         tracing active (if "fwdtrace 2" is set)
  -u         connection is closed immediately, without this parameter S&F
             is waiting for some time if new mails can be forwarded

Note: You should use option "-l" and "-k" ONLY in that case, if S&F partner
can't handle 7plus or autobin mails, like shortwave gateways. Don't restrict
user mails without reason!

Parameter "-b" makes only sense, if S&F partner only supports ASCII S&F
protocol (from WA7MBL). Internally OpenBCM limits the size of one mail at the
moment to 10 MBytes. Every option must be separated through spaces, if
you use more than one.

until you type "EXIT". If you change directory while in OSHELL mode, BBS
is setting the directory back to "/bcm" after EXIT.

If you are running Linux, shell sh is started. Parameter DOSINPUT don't
care running Linux.

Following restrictions must be noticed when running DOS:

Command interpreter is used from system variable COMSPEC, if COMSPEC
is undefined command.com is started.

The execution depends on parameter DOSINPUT, if DOSINPUT is set to 0
you must expect following:
As usual DOS command system calls can only write to standard output (no
direct screen output). Command isn't allowed to wait for ANY user input.
If a program waits for user input, BBS watchdog will hopeful reset PC
and reboot.

If DOSINPUT is set to 1, user input for dos commands are allowed.
For example it's possible to use "o time". So it's recommented to use
this setting for remote sysop.
 - outputs must write to standard output (no direct screen output)
 - input must be "normal" letters incl. CTRL-chars; function keys,
   ALT keys, cursor keys etc. CANNOT be used for input
 - if DOS command is running, the whole BBS is stopped (no
   multitasking), this happens also if dos programs is waiting for
   input; the watchdog resets PC after 30 minutes
 - the program SHROOM for swapping BCM and getting more memory
   isn't working with DOSINPUT 1
 - while a dos program is running, the input queue is permantly
   tested; this can lead to the "nice" behaviour that after sending
   dos command one letter is cut; a command like "o dir;d dl8mbt"
   is not working, because "d" in buffer is cut bei DOS; this effect
   only happens when using DOSINPUT 1

NOTE: In both cases the BBS is stopped while DOS commands are executed,
because external programs can't be executed through multitasking of BBS.
So you should only start small programs. After 30 minutes the watchdog
resets PC. There are some problems with DOS 7.0 and higher reported.

\\PACLEN
(only sysop, init.bcm)
Syntax: PAC(LEN) [<bytes>]
(default: 0)

Sets maximum global paclen. The default value is 0 (means 256 bytes).
Parameter range is between 40-255 (and 0). Sysop can set for each user a
different paclen with command "setuser <call> pac <n>".

See also HELP ALTER PACLEN and HELP SETUSER
\\PAGEBREAK
In order to prevent that the output brims over the screen, you can set a
number of lines after which the BBS stops the output until you send <ENTER>.
You can set the pakebreak with:

A(LTER) L(INES) <lines>

If you want to switch off the pagebreak you have to set "ALTER LINES 0". When
the output is stopped, the BBS displays "+?>" at the end of the last line.
You can cause several actions at this prompt:

<ENTER>   continues the output
C         continues the output, but does not interrupt the output anymore
S         quits output
Q or B    leaves the BBS (disconnect)
anything else aborts the output.

At the command DIR, LIST, READ and CHECK you can switch off the pagebreak
with the option -C.

If the pakebreak is switched off with "ALTER LINES 0" or with C at the
pagebreak prompt, you can abort the output by typing <ENTER>. But you may
not specify another command. Currently it is better to disconnect the BBS,
because the BBS can be reconnected more quickly.
\\PARAMETER
Syntax: PAR(AMETER) <search string>

You can view configuration of BCM with this command. File "init.bcm"
is shown. If you use <search string> only lines matching to this
string are shown.

Example:  par sysopcall
          -> shows call of sysop

For default settings have a look at HELP PARAMETER DEFAULT

\\PASSWORD
If sysop enable password support, each user can setup an own AX25 password.
To use HTTP and POP3 the own name is used as password.
If you login via other nets sysop must setup ttypassword for those users.

Overview:
---------
 account           possible password type        commands
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
all:
 AX25            BayCom, MD2, MD5, Priv      a pw, a pwline, a loginpwtype, pw
 AX25-S&F        BayCom, MD2, MD5, Priv      a pw, a sfpwtype
 sysop           BayCom, MD2, MD5, Priv      sysop, priv, md2, md5
only DOS:
 phone modem     TTY password                a ttypw (only sysop)
only Linux and Windows:
 telnet          TTY password                a ttypw (only sysop)
 telnet-S&F      BayCom, MD2, MD5, Priv, TTY a pw, a sfpwtype and a ttypw
 POP3 (ampr.org) name                        a name
 POP3 (internet) TTY password                a ttypw (only sysop)
 SMTP (ampr.org) name                        a name
 SMTP (internet) TTY password                a ttypw (only sysop)
 HTTP (ampr.org) name                        a name
 HTTP (internet) TTY password                a ttypw (only sysop)

Command "PRIV" can be used if a file "<call>.bcm" or "priv.bcm" exists.
Sysop passwords must be setup in file "passwd.bcm".

When using an AX25-Password, normally HTTP/POP3/NNTP can't be used, because
there should be no security hole for call misusage. If AX25-Password contain
the string "DUMMY" (in capital letters) this restrition is disabled, and
HTTP/POP3/NNTP can be used.

When using SMTP, normally POP3 is needed before SMTP. It's not needed if you
set "alter unsecuresmtp 1".

\\PATH
Syntax: P(ATH) <address>

Shows the direction in which <address> will be forwarded. There will be
all neighbour BBS displayed to which <address> will be forwarded. This
is valid for BBS addresses (for user mails) as well as for distribution
addresses (for bulletins).

Examples:   P DB0KCP         Lists all neighbour BBS to which mails
                             with the address @DB0KCP will be forwarded
            P DL             Lists all neighbour BBS to which mails
                             with the address @DL will be forwarded
            P HA5DI.HUN.EU   Lists all neighbour BBS to which mails
                             with the address @HA5DI.HUN.EU will be forwarded

You can test correct setting of "fwd.bcm" with this command.

                Usermails:  number of user mails which arrived from this BBS
                Then there follows a list of up to 5 neighbour BBS,
                when how many (Count) mails with what runtime (Delay)
                via how many BBS (Hops) arrived. Using this information
                you possibly can suggest a suitable way back for the mails.

 p -ar <addr>   same like "p -a <addr>", but also the WPROT routing infos
                are shown if available

 p -f <addr>    shows if mail can be forwarded to <addr>

 p -s <string>  searches a string in the list of all BBS. This string can
                be part of the H-address or the info part of the R:-header.
                e.g.  p -s #bay  searches for all bavarian BBS
                      p -s bcm   searches for all BCM
                There will be shown the total number of mails of the
                respective BBS, the time when this information has been
                updated last, the H-address and the R:-infoline.

 p -sh <string> only searches in the header lines, not in the addresses

 p -sp <string> only searches in the H-addresses, not in the headers

 p -sc <string> only counts the number of found lines, but does not display
                them.

 p -saf <addr>  compares settings of "fwd.bcm" with local H-address database
                ("hadr4.bcm")

 p -sfn         shows all BBS with path errors

See also HELP PATH EDIT

Syntax: Path -E<subcommand> <parameter>

To make changes in local H-address database "hadr4.bcm".

P -EA <h-address>        defines a new H-address
P -ED <call>             deletes an existing H-address
P -EH <call> <header>    sets a new R: - line
P -ET <call> <date>      sets header to <date>

Note: you can setup a receive header in "future", to define a
single H-address to a fix value for some time.
\\PCFLEX=FLEXNET
\\PCISUTC
(only sysop, init.bcm, only DOS)
Syntax: PC(ISUTC) [ 0 | 1 ]
(default: 0)

Defines if CMOS clock of PC is running UTC or local time. If clock is set to
local time, BCM automatically sets winter/summer time.

\\POCSAGSERVER
(only when enabled by sysop)
Syntax: POCSAGS(ERVER) <command> <group> [parameter]

Notifying function for POCSAG user.

If a new mail for a POCSAG user arrives a mail for his POCSAG server
will be created. The user gets information that a new mail has arrived at
his MYBBS. This mail is transported in BBS board "P". If "P" does not
exist, it will be created as mainboard (not readable for users).

For using POCSAG function there must be a group created (similar
to mailserv) with its users. Following commands are possible:

- NEWGROUP (+G)                add new group
- DELGROUP (-G)                remove complete group
- DESCRIPTION                  description of group
- ADDUSER (+U) / SUBSCRIBE     add user to group
- DELUSER (-U) / UNSUBSCRIBE   delete user from group
- INFO, LIST                   shows all groups

In addition to that there is the possibility to write a mail directly to
a POCSAG user:

  POCSAGS(ERVER) PAGE <callsign> <short text>

<short text> is only allowed to be as long as one input line.

The sysop can enable/disable pocsagserver with command "pocsaglistserver".

\\POP3LOG
(only Linux/Win32)
Syntax: POP3L(OG) ["<search string>"]

Shows all lines of file "trace/pop3log.bcm" which contains the search
string. You must only use " " if <search string> should contain spaces.
If you don't add <search string> the last 2 kBytes of the file are shown.
The <search string> can be a date or call.
\\POP3_PORT
(only sysop, init.bcm, only Linux/Win32)
Syntax: POP3(_PORT) [<n>]
(default: 8110)

Defines port number of TCP/IP POP3 connects, "0" disables the port.
Example:  POP3_PORT 8110

See also HELP PORTNUMBER
\\PORTNUMBER
(only Linux/Win32)
The current port number for TCP/IP connects can be shown with "info" command.

Port numbers can be set with commands SMTP_PORT, POP3_PORT, NNTP_PORT,
HTTP_PORT, TELNET_PORT, SERV_PORT and RADIO_PORT.

Default settings are:
 8021  FTP port
 8025  SMTP port
 8110  POP3 port
 4719  Telnet port
 8080  HTTP port
 8119  NNTP port

If you change port number setting you have to restart BBS.
\\POSTFWD
(only sysop)
Syntax: PO(STFWD)

This command resend user mail to @MYBBS. All not forwarded user mails are
searched and resend, if they are stick to this BBS.

Mails can be stuck to BBS and resend through "postfwd" command, if
- a disconnect or BBS shutdown appears during their arrive in this BBS
- the H-address was unknown when mail arrives
- the mail was addressed wrong, but right MYBBS is known by BBS
- if mail was addressed wrong and MYBBS is unknown, but in the
  meantime a mail of recipient was arrived where his MYBBS can
  be calculated from

"postfwd" resend also mails to forward trigger file which are in this
file. This means, that some mails are added more than one time, so
forward file grews up bigger than needed, if neighbour BBS can't be reached
for some time. But forward file is very small, so harddisk space isn't wasted
too much through this procedure.

"postfwd" should be entered once a day. Use an entry in file "crontab.bcm"
to do this automatically:

file: crontab.bcm
;--------------------
;minute   hour  day month weekday   command
5           2    *    *     *       postfwd
; calls postfwd each day at 2.05
;--------------------
\\PRIV
Syntax: PR(IV) [password]

Shows logindate and time.

See also HELP PASSWORD
\\PS
Syntax: PS [<options>]

"Process status". A list of all current processes. Every logged-in user and
every active screen window gets an own process. There are also background
processes, which control the system.
All active processes are marked with "*" in front of the command line.
Active means, that they are running in time slice mode (i.e. full blast) or
that they are waiting for free Flexnet/Layer2 buffers, i.e. that they output
something. All waiting processes are not marked with "*". Logins with
sysop mode are marked with "s".
If PS is used without options, only active mail processes are shown.

                   interrupted. As the timer (DOS ticker) has a granularity
                   of 55ms, the exact value is used for the identification
                   of the calling position. Insiders can see the reason for

\\PS.PROCESS
The following processes are running permanently or cyclically:

Desktop       the mainscreen, the father of all running processes
Console       a small windows in which all system messages are shown;
              messages about system errors will be written additionally
              into the file "trace/syslog.bcm"
Monitor       a window in which the AX25 traffic is shown
Sysop         the windows in which the sysop is logged in on the screen
logind        login demon. This process tests all TNC channels cyclically
              and looks after new logins and disconnects. From here all
              arriving BBS tasks are created.
forwardd      forward demon. This process tests if there are mails which are
              to be forwarded and, if so, if the time matches with the
              setting in the "fwd.bcm". Every half hour the files
              "bulletin.bcm" and "init.bcm" are written to the harddisk
crond         navigates all crontab processes (e.g. purge, reorg etc.)
purge         mucks out everything. The whole filesystem is searched if
              there is a mails with went off lifetime or deleted mails, which
              will really be deleted then.
reorg         reorganisates the mailsystem of BBS
postfwd       add stuck user mails to forward trigger files "fwd/u_<bbs>.bcm"

\\PURGE
Syntax: PU(RGE)

If you delete a mail with ERASE, the mail only will be marked as erased, but
it will not really be erased. The PURGE command removes all erased mails from
the harddisk. If the PURGE command is executed, the mail-numbers will change.
After PURGE you can not use the UNERASE command anymore.

PURGE is only running, if sysop hasn't disabled this feature with "nopurge 1".

See also HELP PURGE A
\\PURGE.A
(only sysop)
Syntax: PU(RGE) A

Starts purge process for whole BBS. This command normally must only run once a
day and should be set through "crontab.bcm" file.

During purge process all marked mails for erasing and mails whos lifetime
is done are being deleted. Purge really deletes, this means NO possiblity with
UNERASE to undelete those mails. Also all empty subdirectories are deleted.
Sysop can disable purge process with parameter "NOPURGE 1" (See HELP NOPURGE).

The purge process may be running long time if PC is slow and mail database is
big. Purge is done in about 1 minute with modern computers. All other
processes can be proceed during the purge process, maybe only some commands
are a bit slower.

After purge is done, a notice is add to file "trace/syslog.bcm":
format:     mbpurge: 10 era, 20 lt, 234 all
   where  era:  number of mails being purged because of erase
           lt:   number of mails being purged because of lifetime
          all:  all proceeded mails

If PURGE detects a broken "list.bcm" file, this file is being deleted, PURGE
is stopped and REORG is executed. If PURGE detects a broken CHECK file, this
file is being generated again automatically after purge job.

PURGE <board> processes only one board. If no parameter is added the command
is accessable for each user, and is purging his user mailboard.

To disable a purge for a special user mailboard, use ALTER NOPURGE 1.
This can only be done by sysop. So other silly users can't delete
mails anymore. (sysop should use: "setuser <call> nopurge [ 0 | 1 ]")
If PURGE is used for bulletins, the generation of checknumbers are
processed in the background.

See also HELP PURGE CMDS
\\PURGE.CMDS
PURGING of mails can be affected by following commands:
PURGE............starts purge process
NOPURGE..........configurates PURGE (see HELP NOPURGE)
ALTER NOPURGE....disable PURGE of one user board (see HELP ALTER NOPURGE)
\\PW
Syntax: PW
If sysop has set "userpw 2" you can use "pw" for password athentification.
After sending "pw", BCM sends password request depending on setting
of "a loginpwtype" and waits for a correct answer (user PW, not sysop PW).
If "userpw" is not set to 2, BCM is using the same password procedure as you
send "sysop". The result is logged in file "trace/pwlog.bcm".

See also HELP USERPW, HELP ALTER PW, HELP ALTER LOGINP, HELP SYSOP
and HELP PASSWORD
\\PWGEN
(only sysop)
Syntax: PWG(EN) <filename>

With command "PWG(EN) <filename>" you can calculate a random PRIV password.
Note: Don't use this procedure anymore, because it's very unsecure. Use
      MD5 password or BayCom password type instead!

The command "pwg" generates a file "userpw.bcm" with 81 random passwords.
With "setpw <call> <n>" the sysop can then set passwords for users.

See also HELP SETPW
\\PWLOG
Syntax: PWL(OG) ["<search string>"]

Shows all lines of file "trace/pwlog.bcm" which contains the search
string. You must only use " " if <search string> should contain spaces.
If you don't add <search string> the last 2 kBytes of the file are shown.
The <search string> can be a date or call.

All events around password processes are save in "PWLOG":
- user changes his user password
- user returns wrong user password
- sysop return right or wrong sysop password
- a wrong password is used for tty port (serial or telnet)
- S&F password is wrong
- HTTP access with correct cookie
- SMTP without POP3 usage before
Time, call and uplink digi are saved with all these events.
\\PWONLY
(only sysop, init.bcm, only with option _BCMNET in config.h)
Syntax: PWONLY [ 0 | 1 ]
(default: 0)
This is only used in german cb network with BCMNET login-concept.

See also HELP BCMNET
\\Q=QUIT
\\QT
Syntax: QT

Sets new quit time without leaving the BBS.
\\QUIT
Syntax: Q(UIT)

The QUIT command ends the current BBS session. If you choose QUIT, your
last-quit-date will be set. If you only cut the link or if you leave the BBS
with the BYE command, your last-quit-date will not be changed.
\\QUOTA
Syntax: QUO(TA)

Shows, how many bytes of data you have read until now and how many you
can still read, if the sysop has limited the bytes you can read every day.
\\R=READ
\\RADIO_PORT
(only sysop, init.bcm, only Linux)
Syntax: RA(DIO_PORT) [<n>]
(default: 0)

Defines port number for radio interface (Net-CMD interface) for Linux.
This interface is used by Wampes or TNT, there is a TCP/IP socket existing
for use to connect.

Example: "telnet localhost 8134" connects with radio interface.
         Then a "CONNECT AX25 OE1XLR OE3DZW-12" can be used to
         connect to "oe1xir" as "oe3dzw-12".

Interface of wampes and TNT is a bit different, implementation of BCM
interface uses the TNT definition:


--- TNT documentation:
The Netcmd-server works compatible to Wampes. So after connect to the
socket, the server is in command mode and accepts three commands: ASCII,
BINARY and CONNECT. Any other input or wrong arguments lead to a closing of
the connection.

ASCII selects a translation from line feed to carriage return before
transmitting data on the AX25 side and vice versa. This is the default mode.

BINARY selects a transparent connection without any character translation.

CONNECT starts an AX25 connection (..). It needs additional
parameters, the syntax is:

CONNECT <transport mode> <destination callsign> [source callsign]

The only valid value for "transport mode" is AX25, other modes will lead to
a closing of the connection. The destination callsign must not contain any
digipeaters. (...)

After a successful link setup the server will switch to data mode, all
received data will be sent to the socket, all data from the socket will be
transmitted on the AX25 side.

When the link setup was not successful, the socket connection will be simply
disconnected without any further information.
---

The connect the paths defined in file "netpath.bcm" are used.
  ------ l2path.bcm
  ; comments are ignored (start with ;)
  ; format: <to_call>: <path>
  db0clx:  db0clx oe1xlr
  ha5dxx:  ha5dxc oe1xlr oe3xpr
  ------

The interface can be used with port number "radio_port". If "0" is used, the
interface is disabled (default). If you change settings, the BBS must be
restarted.
Example: RADIO_PORT 4718
\\RANGE
You can specify a range everywhere a number of mails (e.g. at the commands
DIR, LIST, READ and ERASE) can be choosen. You can specify a board
in front of the range. If a board is missing, the board is used you worked on
last. If you specify a range, only the mails in this range will be processed.
The current board can be displayed at the prompt (see HELP MACROS).

The range is specified with the mail numbers, which are displayed at the
DIR and LIST command. The newest mail has the largest number. The oldest
mail has number one.

You can select the range in the following ways:

     specified range ! with this range selected mails
    -----------------+---------------------------------
        <nothing>    ! all mails of the current board
            5        ! only number 5
           -7        ! the last (=newest) 7 mails
           1-9       ! the first 9 mails
           3-        ! all mails beginning at number 3
           2-5       ! all mails from 2 by 5 (2, 3, 4 and 5)
        <string>     ! all mails which contain <string> in the title


Examples:   R IBM 1-4          Lists mails 1 to 4 in the board IBM.
            L INFO -10         Lists the last 10 (=newest) mails in the
                               board <INFO>.
            E DX 4             Erases the 4th mail in the boards <DX>.
            D ALINCO "DJ-F4"   Lists all mails of the board <ALINCO>
                               which contain "DJ-F4" in the title.

A specified string will be searched in the list file. Because in the
list file also the BID of a mail is saved, it is possible that a "wrong"
mail is displayed. Depending on the settings of your options after LIST,
DIR, CHECK and READ more or less information about a mail will be displayed.
\\RBIN=RPRG
\\RDIDADIT
(only sysop)
Syntax: RD(IDADIT) [<filename>]

BBS is sending <filename> with DIDADIT transfer protocol.

See also HELP DIDADIT
\\READ
Syntax: R(EAD) [<options>] [<board>] [<range>] ["<string>"]

With the READ command you can read mails. If you do not specify a board,
the command will be related to the board you have used last. To get the
mail numbers use the DIR/LIST command. To get the available options
type HELP OPTION READ.

<range> specifies the mails you want to read. If it is not specified, the last
(that is the newest) mail will be displayed.

Examples:   R OE3DZW 1-10     Displays the first 10 mails of OE3DZW.
            R IBM 13          Displays mail 13 of the board IBM.

See also HELP READ DETAILS, HELP RANGE and HELP OPTION READ
\\READ.BINAER=BINARY
\\READ.DETAILS
Syntax: R(EAD) [<options>] [ <call> | <board> ] [<range>] ["<string>"]

Example:
R -h dl8mbt 1-5
Displays the first 5 mails of DL8MBT and shows the header lines of all BBS
the mails went through.

With   ALTER UREAD <options>   (for usermails)
or     ALTER IREAD <options>   (for bulletins)

you can choose options, which will take effect everytime you use the
READ command. The options specified at the READ command have priority over
the options at ALTER UREAD/IREAD. If you want to switch off an option
specified at ALTER UREAD/IREAD, you have to type an '-' after the option
(e.g. READ -C- 1).

The binary part of a mail can be displayed with option -q ("quiet").
The output has no leadin or leadout. With this option binary files can
be extracted (sysop only), e.g.:   export -b demo.lzh read -q baybox 123

If READ is used with "<string>", only mails with this search string will
be displayed.

See also HELP OPTION READ
\\READLOCK
(only sysop, init.bcm)
Syntax: READL(OCK) [ 0 | 1 ]
(default: 0)

This activates the LIST/READ readlock of user mails.

  READLOCK 0   only sysop can set readlock
               (see HELP SETUSER)
  READLOCK 1   each user can use READLOCK command
               (see HELP ALTER READLOCK)

User who use READLOCK for their user mails can be searched with "u -r"
command. Default setting for each user is, that everybody can read the mails.
\\REDIT
(only sysop, only DOS version)
Syntax: RED(IT)

Short command, same as "EDIT REJECT.BCM".

Don't forget to do a NEW after editing "reject.bcm" with REDIT. If
internal editor is not compiled, REJECTEDIT is executed.

See also HELP REJECTEDIT
\\REGULAR_EXPRESSIONS
"Regular expressions" are signs used for searching purposes. They are
used in OpenBCM in files "convert.bcm", "reject.bcm" and most search
processes.

Sign  Description

 ^    finds beginning of a line at the beginning of a string
 $    finds end of line at the end of string
 .    finds any sign
 *    after string, finds every search string followed with any sign (or no
      sign), e.g.: "bo*" finds "bot", "bo" and "boo" etc but not "b"
 +    after string finds every search string followed with any sign but
      no further signs, e.g.: "bo+" finds "boo" and "booo", but not "bo"
      and "be"
 \    means to use following sign as search string, e.g.: "\^" finds "^"
      and didn't search for beginning of line

 [ ]  finds every single sign, e.g. [bot] finds b, o or t
 [^]  this means negation, e.g. [^bot] finds all signs but no b, o or t
 [-]  means a rangs of letters, e.g. [b-o] finds every letter between
      b and o

The use of curved brackets (means "{" or "}") can't be used in OpenBCM,
although in other implementations of regular expressions they are common.

Examples:
 ^[WE][WU]$	finds as search string "WW", "WU", "EW" or "EU"
 ^S\:		finds "S:" only at beginning of search string
\\REJECT
Syntax: REJ(ECT) [ -a | <string> ]

With option "-a" the whole file "reject.bcm" is shown. If you use <string>
(regular expression) all lines containing this <string> are shown.

The file "reject.bcm" defines which mails are saved in BBS and which are
being rejected or hold. To add comments use a ";" at the beginning of the
comment.

Every line contains a reject rule with following format:
<action> [<from] [>to] [$bid] [@at] [ .B | .P ] ;comment

The first argument <action> defines what should happen if right
expression match:
 R = Message must be rejected
 G = Message must be rejected, if entered locally without AX25-PW
 E = Message must be rejected, if entered locally without AX25-PW/TTYPW
 F = Message must be set on hold, if forwarded without Forward-PW
 H = Message must be set on hold
 L = Message must be set on hold, if entered locally
 P = Message must be set on hold, if entered locally without AX25-PW
 O = Message must be set on hold, if entered locally without AX25-PW/TTYPW

Actions E and O are only possible with Linux/Windows version!

<from                  = sender
>to                    = receiver
$bid                   = (part of a) bid
.B                     = bulletin mail
.P                     = user mail
 !                     = inverted match
 ;                     = comment
 (string1,string2,...  = OR of more than one string

There may be more than one expression each line, all expression must
be matched to do <action>. The strings are handled as regular expressions,
see also HELP REGULAR.

Some examples:
; reject citizen-band calls
  R <CB?CB
; reject BASAR mails
  R >BASAR*
; rejct worldwide OPINION mails
  R >OPINIO* @WW
; df0ar is only allowed to send mail to oe3dzw
  R <^DF0AR$ >!^OE3DZW$ ...
; reject some bids of citizen-band bbs
  R $*DBO123*
  R $*NL3DGH*
; hold all bulletins send without ax25 password (holdtime must be set!)
  P .B
; reject all bulletins send without ax25 password
  G .B
; reject all bulletins send without ax25 password, only mails from
; calls beginning with DB0 or the call DH8YMB is always accepted
  G .B <!(^DB0,^DH8YMB

See also HELP REJECTEDIT
\\REJECTEDIT
(only sysop, option DF3VI_REJ_EDIT in config.h)
Syntax: REJECTEDIT <command> [parameter]

You can easily change "reject.bcm" with this command. There are following
subcommands:
REJECTEDIT LIST   <search string>
REJECTEDIT ADD    <reject line>
REJECTEDIT DELETE <search string>

If internal editor is not compiled, REDIT is executed.

See also HELP REJECTEDIT <command>.
\\REJECTEDIT.LIST
(only sysop)
Syntax: REJ(ECTEDIT) L(IST) <search string>

Search <search string> in file "reject.bcm". If you don't add any
<search string>, the whole file is displayed.

See also HELP REJECT DELETE
\\REJECTEDIT.ADD
(only sysop)
Syntax: REJ(ECTEDIT) ADD <reject line>

Add <reject line> as new reject entry to "reject.bcm".

Example: REJECTED A G <!DB0ZWI .P

See also HELP REJECT
\\REJECTEDIT.DELETE
(only sysop)
Syntax: REJ(ECTEDIT) DELETE <search string>

Deletes first line in file "reject.bcm", where <search string> is matching.

See also HELP REJECT
\\REMERASE
(only sysop, init.bcm)
Syntax: REM(ERASE) [<n>]
(default: 1)

The command REMERASE defines if remote erases are possible and how they are
handled. BCM and DPBox can exchange remote erase information. At BCM a remote
erase can be done with "ERASE -F" command.

There are following options:
  REMERASE 0    remote erase is disabled
  REMERASE 1    remote erase is enabled without any restrictions
  REMERASE 2    remote erase is only accepted, if mail was erased
                from same BBS where it was created
  REMERASE 3    remote erase is only accepted, if mail was erase
                from same BBS where it was accepted; mail is only
                purged after lifetime elapsed, so sysop has possiblity
                to unerase those mails

You can list remote erased mails with "CHECK -R". If you set "REMERASE 3"
and want to really erase those mails you have to do a "unerase <mail>"
and then do a "erase <mail>" again.
\\REORG
(only sysop)
Syntax: REO(RG) [<subcommand>]

Starts reorganisation of all mail information. Files "bid2.bcm"/"bid3.bcm",
"bidh2.bcm", "checknum.bcm", "hadrhash.bcm", "userhash.bcm", "list.bcm" and
"check.bcm" can be restored completly from mail files. For restoring process
all mail files must be read, so if database is very big, this procedure can
take a long time.

The reorg procedure can take between 10 minutes and 5 hours, but
normal process of BBS is not disturbed. Reading operations can be
done with any restrictions. If doing writing operations the save
procedure can take about 10 seconds longer than normal. While
CHECK list and BID database is rebuilt (around 1/3 part of whole reorg time)
writing operations (SEND command) are not allowed. User gets a
note about that.

REORG creates tempfiles during process ("list.$$$" and "check.$$$"),
these files are renamed after finishing REORG. So, it's not critical
if power fails during reorg. You need enough space on your harddisk
to save a copy of "users4.bcm" (around 30-40 MBytes).

Subcommands of REORG:
 REORG B  only build new "list.bcm" for bulletins
 REORG C  only build new "check.bcm" (from existing "list.bcm" files)
 REORG F  create all "list.bcm" new, maybe add BIDs missing in BID database,
          then like reorg (without parameters)
 REORG H  only H-address (build hash and do a check)
 REORG I  rebuild BID database file (build hash and do a check)
 REORG L  rebuild user database (build hash and do a check)
 REORG N  creates new list of boardname ("checknum.bcm"),
          "reorg n" is included if you do a "reorg c"
 REORG P  erase old entries from user database
 REORG U  rebuild only "list.bcm" for user mails
 REORG X  delete double existing bulletins

 REORG    <without parameters> makes a default reorg which contains
          of: reorg b+c+h+i+u

REORG L, REORG P and REORG X must be called manuell if needed.
While REORG is running you can look with PS command which part of reorg
is running.

See also HELP REORG L, HELP REORG P and HELP REORG X
\\REORG.L
(only sysop)
Syntax: REO(RG) L

To check the call list it's necessary to create a copy of this list. That's
the reason why a lot of hdd space is needed to run "reorg l". In addition
to that the "reorg l" process may take a long time, so you should only call
that command if there are errors in call list. During "reorg l" a check is
done, if user settings makes sense. If an entry has errors, a line with note
is added to "trace/syslog.bcm".
\\REORG.P
(onyl sysop)
Syntax: REO(RG) P

Deletes all user entries from user database "user4.bcm", which hasn't
defined a MYBBS at this BBS, has no name specified or if entry is older
than double userlifetime (min. 180 days). This means, all learned entries of
received mails are deleted. You should only use this command if user database
is to big. If you use a harddisk > 1GB it really don't make sense of doing
a "reorg p" to save harddisk space!
\\REORG.X
(only sysop)
Syntax: REO(RG) X

The command renames existing BID files, reads all existing bulletin
mails, deletes double found and than copies files back. You should
not disturb this process, if doing so (e.g. power fail) try to copy
manuell files bids2.reo and bidh2.reo back to *.bcm files.

The BID files are smaller during "reorg x" process than normal.
Note: don't copy those files during "reorg x" is running! This can lead
to data loose!

During "reorg x" BBS is set to disable automatically, because the
execution is critical. Before starting, no other user/BBS should
be logged in. During running no new mails should be received.
If you follow above notes, the procedure is running with trouble
and you have no risc. But don't use "reorg x" to often, because
process is may running quite long (about 1-4 hours).

\\REPLY
Syntax: REP(LY) [ [<board>] <range> ] [<title>]

After having read a mail you can simply send an answer to the sender
by using the REPLY command. All needed data of the recipient (call, forward
address) will be taken from the read mail.

If you specify a board and a range, the command will be related to all
specified mails. If you use "K" as dir/list option, all replied user mails
are marked with "r" instead of "R" or ")".
If you do not specify a title, the used title will be "RE:" plus the
title of the original mail. If reply is used more than one time, "RE^n:"
is used instead of "RE: RE: RE: RE:".

\\RLOG
Syntax: RLOG ["<search string>"]

Shows the last 2 kBytes of file "rejlog.bcm".
If you add a search string, all lines matching to the string are shown.

See also HELP REJECT
\\RMBOARD
(only sysop)
Syntax: RMB(OARD) <main boardname> <sub boardname>

Deletes a board. The board must be empty (use ERASE and PURGE before).
If you want to delete a mainboard, you should delete all subboards before.

Example:   RMBOARD software/baycom
                or
           RMBOARD software baycom

The file "bulletin.bcm" is updated automatically.

See also HELP ERASE and HELP PURGE
\\RMNC=FLEXNET
\\RPRG
(only sysop)
Syntax: RP(RG) <filename>

BBS is sending <filename> with binary protocol. Format is autobin.
Transfer datarate is shown. Output starts before string #OK# is
received (so don't care).

See also HELP RTEXT
\\RTEXT
(only sysop)
Syntax: RT(EXT) <filename>

BBS is sending <filename> as textfile.
See also HELP RPRG
\\RUBRIK=BOARDS
\\RUNUTILS
Syntax: RUN(UTILS) [ -l | -s | -ls ]

Shows all installed runutils.

Runutils are small external programs which can be called from BBS soft.
In- and output to runutils is handled via BBS. If you are running DOS
the BBS is being stopped while runutil is running. If you are running
Linux or Win32, BBS is running same time runutil is executed (multitasking).

Note: if a runutil is defined as "interactive" in "runutil.bcm" they can
      only be called once and not in combination with other commands!

RUNUTILS -l: shows detail information of runutils
RUNUTILS -s: shows runutils which can be executed only as sysop

The configuration of runutils is done in file "runutil.bcm".

See also HELP OPTION RUNUTIL
\\RYAPP
(only sysop)

BBS is sending <filename> with YAPP transfer protocol.

See also HELP YAPP
\\S=SEND
\\S&F
Abbreviation for "Store and Forward".

See also HELP ADDRESS, HELP FORWARD and HELP UFWD
\\SA
Syntax: SA

Sends a mail of type "acknowledge". Normally this makes no sense and it's
only for internal usage.
\\SAVEBROKEN
(only sysop, init.bcm)
Syntax: SAV(EBROKEN) [ 0 | 1 | 2 ]
(default: 0)

This command defines forward handling of 7plus bulletin mails:
SAVEBROKEN 0      only correct 7plus files are accepted and saved
SAVEBROKEN 1      if using FBB forward all bulletins with 7plus are
                  accepted, if using unsecure ASCII forward protocol,
                  only mail with correct CRC and lenght are accepted
SAVEBROKEN 2      all bulletins are excepted

If 7plus mails are correct, a "(7+)" is add to title, if 7plus mails are
corrupt, they are marked with "(7-)".
\\SB
Syntax: SB <board> [@<address>] [#<lifetime>] [<title>]

Sends a bulletin mail.

See also HELP SEND and HELP SEND DETAIL
\\SCMDLIST
(onyl sysop)
Syntax: SC(MDLIST)

\\SEMAPHORES=STATUS.SEMAPHORES
\\SEND
Syntax: S(END) [ <call> | <board> ] [@<address>] [#<lifetime>] <title>

SEND is used to send a mail to the BBS.

<call/board> Call for which the mail is destined, or boardname in which
             the mail is to be saved. A list of all board can be seen
             with "DIR BOARDS". Do not use self made abbreviations!

<address>    The S&F address for the mail. If the mail is not to be forwarded
             or if the the BBS knows the address, you can leave it out.
             For user mails, the call of the home BBS is specified here.
             This should be (especially to foreign countries) the complete
             hierarchical address (e.g. DB0AAB.#BAY.DEU.EU or OE5XBL.AUT.EU).
             For bulletins a distribution address is used in which the mail is
             to be forwarded. Possible distribution addresses are @DL or @EU,
             for example. See HELP ADDRESS and HELP FORWARD.

<lifetime>   Time in days how long the mail is to be kept (max. 999). This
             information will be forwarded to the other BBS. Due to this the
             mail should be deleted after this time in all BBS. For mails
             which are of interest only for a certain period of time
             the lifetime should absolutely be used (see also HELP LT).

<title>      This should be a short, but CLEAR hint, which the mail is about.
             Empty phrases like "PSE READ!" or "HELP!" will have the result
             that nobody reads the mail, because of the daily flood of mails.

Examples:

>S BAYCOM @ DL #10 New version 1.70
>Hello!
>....
>73 de OZ1KUZ
>nnnn

>S OE3DZW @ OE3XSR.#OE3.AUT.EU Hi Dietmar
>Hallo OM!
>Kommst Du heute vorbei?
>73 de Reiner!
>nnnn

If the specified hierarchical address is unknown the BBS will display an
error message. You can send the mail anyway, but it only will stay in the
BBS and it will not be forwarded.

If you want to send one mail to more than one user, it makes sense
to write this mail to your call one time and then use TRANSFER command
to deliver to others. Or you try to use mailserv (see also HELP MAILSERV).

The mail can be ended with nnnn, ***END, /EX or ^Z (Ctrl-Z).
You can abort entering of a mail with ^X (Ctrl-X).

See also HELP SEND BINAER, HELP BOARD, HELP ADDRESS,
HELP SEND ACK, HELP LT, HELP FORWARD and HELP SEND ATTACH
\\SEND.ACK
If a mail contains "/ACK" or "/ack" an acknowledge is sent from target BBS
to sender call to tell that the mail has received its target. Such acknowledge
mails have "ACK:..." in the title and don't contain any R:-header lines.
An acknowledge is sent after first read. Only if the mail is read with
option "-G", no acknowledge is sent. /ACK is not working with BIN or 7+ mails.
\\SEND.ATTACH
(only sysop)
Syntax: .attach <filename>

You can attach as sysop any file existing on BBS PC to a mail as autobinary
attachment. You have to write ".attach" in small letters and it can't be
shortend.

Example:
  s dl8mbt @ db0aab
  Leseutility
  Anbei neuestes Util util.tgz
  .attach src/util.tgz

In this example the file "util.tgz" in bcm-subdirectory "src" is attached to
the mail.

You can automatically add binary files into an import file:
-------------------
os BS -2 file.zip
s board file.b01
.attach file.b01
s board file.b02
.attach file.b02
-------------------
Nevertheless it's not possible to import a BS upload file, because those
files include special binary characters which import can't handle.
Filenames have to be less than 50 characters, if they are longer
they will be truncated, but filename ending will be kept.
\\SEND.BINAER=BINAER
\\SERV
(only sysop, only Linux/Win32))
Using Linux, a simple service interface is available outside of BBS.
Four commands are possible:

TRACE ON | OFF          starts output of "trace/syslog_r.bcm"
MONITOR ON | OFF        starts monitor
CMD <command>           executes <command>
QUIT                    leaves serv interface

You can login via telnet. The interface is only working if host, where telnet
is started, is added to "rhosts.bcm" file.

Example:      telnet localhost 8123

See also HELP SERV_PORT
\\SERV_PORT
(only sysop, init.bcm, only Linux/Win32)
Syntax: SER(V_PORT) [<n>]
(default: 8123)

Defines the port number of the service interface. "0" disables the port.
Example: SERV_PORT 0

See also HELP PORTNUMBER and HELP SERV
\\SETLIFETIME
Syntax: LT or SET(LIFETIME) <board> <range> [#] <days>

Sets the lifetime of one or more mails. A period of time has to be specified
in days beginning at the current day. The lifetime only can be changed by the
owner of the mail (sender or recipient). You can specify the "#"-sign, but
it is not necessary (only because of the compability to Thebox). If no
range is specified, SETLIFE relates to the last read mail. The range is
allowed between 0 and 999.

Examples:   SETL BAYCOM 5-10 30    Sets mails 5-10 in board BAYCOM to new
                                   lifetime of 30 days.
            SETL #100              Sets last-read mail to live 100 days.
                                   (Here '#' may NOT be ommited!)
\\SETPW
(only sysop)
Syntax: SETP(W) <call> <n>
Sysop can set a password for an user. Passwords must be generated with "pwg".
See also HELP PWG
\\SETUSER
(only sysop)
Syntax: SETU(SER) <call> <command> [<parameter>]

The command is the same like ALTER, but you have to add a call.

Example:
  SETU DG3MFW F DB0AAB
is same like
  CALL DG3MFW;A F DB0AAB

Other examples:
  SETU DG3MFW NAME Matthias
  SETU DL8MBT TTYPW xyzxyz

There are some ALTER commands, which can only be set sysop:
DELETE, FHOLD, RLIMIT, STATUS and TTYPW.

See also HELP SETUSER FHOLD, HELP SETUSER RLIMIT, HELP SETUSER STATUS,
HELP SETUSER TTYPW and HELP ALTER SYSOP
\\SETUSER.FHOLD
(only sysop)
Syntax: SETU(SER) <call> FH(OLD) [ 0 | 1 ]
(default: 0)

If set to "1" all bulletins from that user are holded and did not become
forwarded to other BBS. User mails are forwarded. The bulletins are not purged
but only holded. They can be send through sysop to other BBS with FORWARD
command. Sysops should only use this function in single caused cases!

See also HELP SETUSER
\\SETUSER.RLIMIT
(only sysop)
Syntax: SETU(SER) RLI(MIT) [ 0 | 1 ]
(default: 0)

Similar to ALTER READLOCK, but user can not change it.
\\SETUSER.STATUS
(only sysop)
Syntax: SETU(SER) <call> STATUS [<n>]
(default: 0)

SETU <call> ST 0   to set user to normal mode
SETU <call> ST 1   to deactivate USERQUOTA for this call
SETU <call> ST 2   to reject a user
All other values than above have no meaning.

See also HELP SETUSER and HELP USERQUOTA
\\SETUSER.TTYPW
(only sysop)
Syntax: SETU(SER) <call> T(TYPW) <password>
(default: off)

To set a password for TTY (TTY login and TTY S&F), max. 8 characters.

See also HELP TTY
\\SPEECH=ALTER.SPEECH
\\SF
Syntax: SF [ <call> | all ]

Starts forwarding to <call>. <call> may be a S&F partner or a user S&F call.
You may only use this command for testing purpose, because the S&F connect is
normally done automatically. If a connection to <call> exists, command is
ignored. With "sf all" you can start forward daemon, this means a connect to
all S&F partners are being started.
\\SFHOLD
Syntax: SFH(OLD) ["<search string>"]

If a mail is hold this mail is added to "trace/sfhold.bcm". This command shows
this file and you can search for a string.
\\SFONLY
(only sysop, init.bcm)
Syntax: SFO(NLY) [ 0 | 1 ]
(default: 0)

SFONLY 0: normal BBS usage
SFONLY 1: only S&F BBS usage, the sysop call can connect, other user
          only if they know sysop password
\\SHUTDOWN
(only sysop)
Syntax: SHU(TDOWN) [-r]

Exit BBS. If sysop is working at console he can use <ctrl>-x instead
of "shutdown". If you add option "-r" and running DOS the computer is
also rebooted.
\\SID
After a forward connect the two mailbox system are exchanging some characters
which are called SID (System IDentifier). This SID is used for defining the
forward protocol.

Overview of basic SID:
- the SID has following structure: "[f1-f2-f3]"
- (-) defines the end of first field and the beginning of the next field.Felds.
- f1, f2 and f3 does not contain the characters "[" or "]".
- f1 is the identifier of the software.
- f2 contains software specific data, e.g. the version number of the software.
- f3 is a string of alphanumeric characters and defines the set of features
  the mailbox know. Every character defines one feature. numbers can be added
  after each character to define a revision number of that feature. if a number
  is missing, revisionnumber 0 is used be default.

OpenBCM mailbox is sending the following SID:
    [OpenBCM-1.03-AB1D1FHMRW$]
                  ^known features
             ^version number
     ^name of the software

Following features are known at the moment:
- A: ACK-Mails are generated and send
- B: compressed forward like F6FBB
- B1: Resume mode when doing forward like F6FBB
- D: DieBox extensions
- D1: block CRCs when doing forward like F6FBB
- F: batch forward like F6FBB
- H: hierarchical address can be handled
- M: MIDs can be handled (BIDs for personal mails)
- R: reject messages can be handled
- W: WPROT like OE3DZW
- Z: "BCMNET Loginkonzept" is handled (german citizen band)
- $: BIDs (Bulletin-IDs) can be handled

The Feature D is defined as following:
- boardnames up to 8 characters are supported.
- lifetime are send to partner mailbox system.
- AutoBIN mails are supported and forwarded.
- forward of Erase-/MyBBS-mails (E/M-Mails)

The character D was defined by DL8HBS and means "D"L8HBS or "D"ieBox.
The D-extensions are used at the moment by following systems:
- BayCom/OpenBCM-Mailbox (DL8MBT, OE3DZW, DG9MHZ, DH3MB, DK2UI, DH8YMB)
- Digi-Point-Mailbox (DL8HBS)
- DieBox (DF3AV, DL1BDY) - jedoch derzeit teilweise ohne "D" im SID
- WinGT-Mailbox (DG8NDL)
- MCuT-Mailbox (DG6VJ, DG4IAD)

The existens of a SID, implicated that the system can change the forward
way and can handle OK/NO-commands.

OpenBCM mailbox passes each received SID and searches for $ character. If
the $ character is not included into SID, forward will be disconnected by
OpenBCM mailbox, because systems without BID are not supported.

The SID of other mailbox system can also contain:
- A (F6FBB):   ACK messages are known (forward command SA)
- B (F6FBB):   only in addition with F: Huffman-compressed S&F
- B1 (F6FBB):  as B, but with CRC at beginning of each mail; resume-mode added
- C (CBBS):    automatic clock setting (obsolet)
- D (DL8HBS):  boardnames up to 8 characters, CRC-16, in addition with B also
               compressed, in addition with B1 also better CRC
- D1 (DL8HBS): as D plus block CRC-mode in compressed forward
- F (F6FBB):   Batch forward like F6FBB, use F6FBB syntax
- H (W0RLI):   system can handle hierarchical address
- I (W0RLI):   system can handle "zero command", a line beginning with (;)
- L (G1NNA):   compression like G1NNA (obsolet)
- M (W0RLI):   can handle MIDs (BIDs for personal mails)
- R (AA4RE):   reject messages can be handled
- X (W0RLI):   X-Forward
- Y (WA7MBL):  forward with YAPP protocol
- $ (WA7MBL):  Bulletin IDentifier can be handled; the dollar character must be
               the last sign in field f3!

Some examples of known SIDs:
 [RLI-17.5-HIX$]
 w0rli V17.5, using BID, H-Adr., Null-commands and X-Forward.

 [CBBS-5.1-$]
 ag3f Version der rli/gyq cbbs.

 [MSYS-1.16-H$]
 wa8bxn V1.16, using BID and H-Adr.

 [MBL-5.14-H$]
 wa7mbl V5.12, using BID and H-Adr.

 [4RE-2.3-MH$]
 aa4re V2.3, using MID, BID, and H-Adr.

 [DP-4.10-AB1DFHMR$]
 DigiPoint V4.10, F6FBB & DieBox options are used.
\\SLEEP
Syntax: SLE(EP) <seconds>

Command "sleep <seconds>" makes only sense if you use it inside of
importfiles. If an importfile calls another importfile you can use sleep
to wait until second importfile has finished (if you know the time).

test.imp:
----------
o copy send.txt+weather.txt+end.txt  newmail.imp
imp newmail.imp
sleep 10
o del newmail.imp
----------
\\SLOG
Syntax: SL(OG) ["<search string>"]

This command shows file "trace/syslog.bcm" where all system messages
are logged. If you add <search string> only those lines matching to
search string are shown. You need to add " " if search string should contain
spaces. You can use a date or call as search string.
If you don't use <search string> the last 2 kBytes are shown.

See also HELP TRACELEVEL and HELP SLR
\\SLR
(only sysop)
Syntax: SLR ["<search string>"]

This command shows file "trace/syslog_r.bcm" where all system, user and S&F
activities are logged. If you add <search string> only those lines matching
to search string are shown. You need to add " " if search string should
contain spaces. You can use a date or call as search string. If you don't
use <search string> the last 2 kBytes are shown.

See also HELP TRACELEVEL and HELP TG
\\SMOOTHHEADER
(sysop, init.bcm)
Syntax: SMOOTHHEADER [ 0 | 1 ]
(default: 0)

If SMOOTHHEADER is set to "1" only a short mailheader is shown:
- no "Subj."
- "From:" and "To:" are in one line
- no "Reply to:" line
These information are shown in mailheader if value is set to "0". This
should be the normal setting, because a lot of mail programs can't handle
the short header syntax (e.g. mailspy programs).
\\SMTP
(only Linux/Win32)

BCM has a TCP/IP mail interface since version 1.39n. This means that
email can be sent via TCP/IP-SMTP to packet radio network. Mails are
automatically converted to packet radio conditions. To read mails
via TCP/IP use POP3 protocol (see HELP POP3).

   * To connect to SMTP server use port number 8025 (default, ask sysop
     if he set to other portnumber). To send mails via SMTP you have
     to use a correct mail address, e.g. dg9mhz@db0aab.#bay.deu.eu.
     You can send mail to other user with valid call or to boardnames.
     SMTP server supports 100 different recipients for each mail.
   * To read mail, use POP3 protocol (default port number is 8110).
     To connect use same login and password as for HTTP server
     (see HELP HTTP). Binary and 7plus files are automatically converted
     to Base64 format.

See also HELP SMTP CONFIG
\\SMTP.CONFIG
This is a configuration example for SMTP user clients (this example
is made for Netscape Communicator's v4.01 and db0aab BCM server).

Add a new profile with program "User Profile Manager". Use following
configuration:

     Add your name at field "name":
     Deti Fliegl

     Add your email address:
     dg9mhz@db0aab.#bay.deu.eu

     Add name of profile:
     BayBox

     Again add your name and email address. Use
     db0aab-bbs.ampr.org:8025
     as SMTP Server.

     The "Mail Server User Name" is:
     dg9mhz

     Define "Incoming Mail Server":
     db0aab-bbs.ampr.org:8110

     That's all. Start your communicator and go to "Edit/Preferences",
     select "Mail&Groups/Mail Server". Under line "POP3" there is a
     checkbox "Leave Messages on server after retrieval". Click on it if
     you want that your mails are available later via "normal" packet radio
     access to BBS. If you don't want to store mails, uncheck this checkbox.

One other general hint: If your TCP/IP server doesn't support any
nameserver (DNS) you have to use IP address instead of hostnames or you
add those IP address to your hosts file on your client system:

   * using windows you can find this file under "\windows\hosts"
   * using winNT look for "\winnt\system32\drivers\etc\hosts"
   * using Linux/Unix use "/etc/hosts"
\\SMTPLOG
(only Linux/Win32)
Syntax: SMTPL(OG) ["<search string>"]

Shows all lines of file "trace/smtplog.bcm" which contains the search
string. You must only use " " if <search string> should contain spaces.
If you don't add <search string> the last 2 kBytes of the file are shown.
The <search string> can be a date or call.
\\SMTP_PORT
(only sysop, init.bcm, only Linux/Win32)
Syntax: SM(TP_PORT) [<n>]
(default: 8025)

Defines port number for TCP/IP SMTP access. With "0" port is switched off.
Example: SMTP_PORT 8025

See also HELP PORTNUMBER and HELP SMTP
\\SP
Syntax: SP <call> [@<address>] [#<lifetime>] [<title>]

Sends a user mail for <call>.

See also HELP SEND
\\SPEAK=ALTER.SPEECH
\\SSID
SSID is the number after a callsign. Used for separation purposes.
\\STATUS
Syntax: ST(ATUS) <subcommand>

Shows statistical data.

See HELP STATUS <subcommand>

Subcommands are:  FORWARD    .. status forward
                  CPU        .. status cpu
                  MEMORY     .. status memory
                  OPENFILES  .. status openfiles
                  SEMAPHORES .. status semaphores
                  LIMITS     .. status limits
(Linux/Win32)     IPSOCKETS  .. status ipsockets
(Linux/Win32)     POPSTATE   .. status popstate

Example:   HELP STATUS CPU   Shows help for STATUS CPU.
\\STATUS.CPU
Syntax: ST(ATUS) C(PU)

Shows the average loading of the BBS. The loading of the BBS is meassured
in 5 seconds intervals and is saved over 8 meassure periods.
So the loading of the last 40 seconds is shown. The loading will be shown
in percent. There will be distinguished between:
  Running:  The time the BBS CPU works. This is normally BBS service.
  Screen:   The time the BBS writes on the screen. If nobody sits at
            the BBS computer, you see how much the monitor window needs.
  Idle:     The time the computer either does nothing or he is busy
            with scheduling. If the loading is high, this will be a low value.
  The sum of all 3 values always results 100%.

Running Linux or WinNT the calculation is a bit unaccurate. Value "screen"
has no meaning.
Example: STATUS CPU
\\STATUS.FORWARD
Syntax: ST(ATUS) F(ORWARD) [<boxcall>]

Lists statistics for forward. If no <boxcall> is added, a statistic about
all forward partners is shown.

The following information will be displayed:
  - BBS:      call of the BBS to which mails have to be forwarded
  - Status:   status of connect:
                ok       = last fwd-connect was ok
                setup    = fwd-connect is setup
                no link  = last fwd-connect resumed with error
                f end    = fwd-connect is ending
                a recv   = mail receive with ASCII mode
                a send   = mail send with ASCII mode
                f recv   = mail receive with FBB mode
                f recvp  = mail receive proposal with FBB mode
                f delay  = delay with FBB mode
                f send   = mail send with FBB mode
                f sendp  = mail send proposal with FBB mode
                filefwd  = fileforward with this mailbox activated
  - In:       period since the last successful received mail from BBS
              (if there is nothing shown here, there was not a connect yet)
  - Out:      period since the last successful transmitted mail to BBS
              (if there is nothing shown here, there was not a connect yet)
  - MailTX:   amount of transmitted mails
  - MailRX:   amount of received mails
  - RTT:      needed time for connecting
  - User:     number of user mails not yet forwarded
  - Info:     number of bulletins not yet forwarded
  - WP/EM:    number of WP/Erase/MYBBS information not yet forwarded
  - Bytes:    amount of data volume not yet forwarded

Total adds the amount of all not yet forwarded mails of all s&f partners.
All data display the results since last BBS restart or BBS initialisation
with NEW command.

Example: ST F DB0AAB

See also HELP NEW.
\\STATUS.IPSOCKETS
Syntax: ST(ATUS) I(PSOCKETS)

Shows current used IP sockets.
\\STATUS.LIMITS
Syntax: ST(ATUS) L(IMITS)

Shows information about system usage and limit values. DOS, Linux and BCM32
have different limit values. The max. amount of bulletin mails is calculated
from free disc space.

Example:
Item        Current    Limit
rubriknames      34     6000
convnames        1      5000
convlifes        0      5000
fwdpartners      2        50
fwddestlen     706     20000
h-address      101     65535
bids         10962    210000
users         1136         -
infomails       12      9100
u-mailcalls     10     60000
languages       27        40
\\STATUS.MEMORY=MEM
\\STATUS.OPENFILES
Syntax: ST(ATUS) O(PENFILES)

Shows information about opened files.
\\STATUS.POPSTATE
Syntax: ST(ATUS) P(OPSTATUS)

Shows who has used which IP address for POP3 logins (file "popstate.bcm").
\\STATUS.SEMAPHORES
Syntax: ST(ATUS) S(EMAPHORES)
(debugging command, practically of no use, you may use SEM(APHORES) instead)

Lists the files which are current processed. There is shown the filename and
the number of the processes, depending on its state:
Rd   read       (process ends in the forseeable future)
LRd  long read  (i.e. process may last any period of time)
Ap   append
LAp  long append
Wr   write
LWr  long write
Op   options (if file is deleted when closed or disconnect)

As write processes exclude each other at multiuser operation, the calling
process will depending on the access time either be suspended or the call
will be rejected.
\\STIMEOFFSET
(only sysop, only DOS, init.bcm)
Syntax: STI(MEOFFSET) [<hours>]
(default: 1)

Defines the different between local and utc time. Use "1" for
western europe. The summer time is calculated automatically depending
on the date. If you don't won't to use summer time (e.g. US), set also
the parameter "summertime" to value "0".

There are two configurations which make sense:
a) PC runs with UTC   -> pcisutc 1, stimeoffset 1
b) PC runs local time -> pcisutc 0, stimeoffset 1 (western europe)

If you have case b) the cmos clock is set automatically.

Linux and Windows systems get the information about the timezone from
the operating system itself. That's why this command is only available
for the DOS version.

See also HELP PCISUTC and HELP SUMMERTIME
\\SUMMERTIME
(only sysop, only DOS and Windows, init.bcm)
Syntax: Summertime [ 0 | 1 ]
(default: 1)

Defines if the automatic summer time function of OpenBCM should be used or
not. A value of "1" is normally used in western europa. If the system is
used in a country that has no summer time, a value of "0" is the best choice.

Note: this value is not intended to be used to switch between summer and
winter time manually - that does the system itself, if summer time is set to
the value "1"!

Linux systems get the information about summertime from the operating system
itself. That's why this command is not available for the linux version.
\\SWAPLOG
(only sysop)
Syntax: SW(APLOG) ["<search string>"]

This command shows all lines of file "trace/swap.bcm", which include
<search string>. This file is used to log all mails where "FROM" and "TO"
fields are not similar to mail header or the BID are changed (means those
mails are swapped by another mailbox system). These mails are set to a
lifetime of 2 days, while sysop can do examines and may set lifetime to a
higher value.

The <search string> can include a special date or call. If <search string>
is not added the last 2kB of file are shown. You only need " " if
<search string> contains spaces. Upper/lower case is of no matter.
The <search string> is handled as a regulary expression.

See also HELP REGULAR_EXPRESSIONS and HELP DEFSWAPLF
\\SYSOP
(only sysop)
Syntax: SY(SOP)

Password authentification for sysop (file "passwd.bcm").

See also HELP PASSWORD
\\SYSOPBELL
(parameter, only DOS)
Syntax: SYSOPB(ELL) [ 0 | 1 ]
(default: 0)

Defines a beep at each connect and disconnect if you use value "1".

Example:  SYSOPBELL 0      -> disable beep sounds
\\SYSOPCALL
(only sysop, init.bcm)
Syntax: SYSOPC(CALL) [<call>]

Defines the sysop call. This call is used if you login with dot (.) at
console. There are no other meanings for this call. You can also define
BBS call as sysopcall. Users can look for sysopcall with "par sysop".
If a user sends a mail to "SYSOP" without areacode, this mail is send to
the call which is defined through sysopcall.

Example:  SYSOPCALL DL8MBT
\\T=TALK
\\TAIL
(only sysop)
Syntax: TAI(L) [-f] <filename>

TAIL without option F shows last 2 kBytes of <filename>.

Example: TAIL stat.imp

If you use option -f (follow) only those is shown which is current
added to that file. Running DOS you can only use this option -F
if you have loaded SHARE.EXE in autoexec.bat. Some runutils
may not run when using SHARE.EXE.

Examples:   TAIL -f trace/syslog_r.bcm
            TAIL -f log/log41109.bcm

See also HELP BEGIN
\\TALK
Syntax: T(ALK) [ A(LL) | <call> ] <text>
(You may use CHA(T), CO(NVERS), M(SG) or W(RITE) instead)

Sends <text> to <call>. The specified user must be connected with the BBS
if you want to use this command.

T <call>
Everything you type after this command will be sent to <call>. Type "/q"
if you want to leave this mode.

T ALL <text>
Sends <text> to all stations connected with the BBS (the same as WALL).

Instead of TALK you also may use the commands CHAT, CONVERS, MSG and WRITE.
So everybody may use the command he likes.
Note: There exists one buffer for text transmissions. If the user reads
a long mail the buffer may run over. In this case an error message will
be displayed.

While in convers mode following command are possible:
/Quit /Bye /User /Who /Talk /Msg /Chat /Send !<cmd>

Quit, Bye: quit convers mode
User, Who: shows userlist
Talk, Msg, Chat, Send: - you can send another test with /T <call> <text>
                         to another user
                       - you can change convers partner with /T <call>
!<command>: The command is executed as at BBS prompt.

Examples:   T DL8MDW Hi Chris
            WALL The BBS will be shut down in 5 minutes!
            M DG3RBU
\\TCPIPTRACE
(only sysop, init.bcm, only Linux/Win32)
Syntax: TCPIPTRACE <n>
(Default: 0)

This parameter defines if TCPIP tracing should be activ or not. These
tracefiles may be interessting in searching bugs in tcpip protocoll.

   tcpiptrace 0  -> no tracing of any TCPIP sessions
   tcpiptrace 1  -> tracing of HTTP sessions in trace/httplog.bcm activ
   tcpiptrace 2  -> tracing of NNTP sessions in trace/nntplog.bcm activ
   tcpiptrace 3  -> tracing of POP3 sessions in trace/pop3log.bcm
   tcpiptrace 4  -> tracing of SMTP sessions in trace/smtplog.bcm
   tcpiptrace 5  -> tracing of FTP sessions in trace/ftplog.bcm
   tcpiptrace 8  -> tracing of all TCPIP sessions (means NNTP, HTTP,
                    POP3, SMTP, FTP)
\\TELL
(only if enabled by sysop)
Syntax: TELL <boxcall> <command>

Each user can use TELL command like in Thebox to execute a command at
target BBS. The result is send back as user mail. All commands which
change a something (e.g. ALTER, ERASE) or need an input (e.g. SEND)
can't be used. The READ command is limited to ONE mail with 530 lines.
Output of binary mail is not possible.

See also HELP TELLMODE
\\TELLMODE
(only sysop, init.bcm)
Syntax: TELLM(ODE) [ 0 | 1 | 2 ]
(default: 2)

TELLMODE 0: BBS doesn't support TELL
TELLMODE 1: tell commands are allowed but not executed
TELLMODE 2: input and execution of tell commands are allowed
\\TELN=TELNET_PORT
\\TELNET
BCM offers a telnet login via TCP/IP.

You can reach BBS via telnet from command line if route to <boxcall> is set:
$ > telnet <boxcall> 4719
<boxcall> may be also "localhost".

It doesn't make sense to use telnet via air, but if you are using BCM
with wired lan this is the best possiblity to reach BBS.
The portnumber of the telnet server can be set with TELNET_PORT command,
default value is 4719. You can also setup portnumber with command line
parameter "bcm -t [port]".

Example:
$ > telnet server 4719
Trying 172.16.1.1...
Connected to server.local.net.
Escape character is '^]'.

If you have to use a password is caused by following:

"rhosts.bcm" - all trusted hosts are saved in this file; if there
is a telnet connect from one of these computers, no password is asked.
After login the user has sysop status and can use "connect" command!
Be careful!
All other logins have to use TTY password (see HELP ALTER TTY) set by sysop.
After login the user has no sysop status.

See also HELP TELNET FORWARD and HELP TELNET_PORT
\\TELNET.FORWARD
(only sysop, only Linux/Win32)
S&F via a telnet connection.

Format for path definition in "fwd.bcm" if using telnet forward is:
"telnet:44.143.48.2:4719"

You have to add the portnumber in any case! TTY password is used for
active and passive S&F.
\\TELNET_PORT
(onyl sysop, init.bcm, only Linux/Win32)
Syntax: TELN(ET_PORT) [<n>]
(default: 4719)

Defines port number for telnet logins. With "0" port is switched off.
Example: TELNET_PORT 4719

See also HELP PORTNUMBER and HELP TELNET
\\TEST
(only sysop)
Syntax: TE(ST) [S | V | W | <macro> ]

S = quit BCM
V = reboot computer
W = watchdog test
<macro> = test macro
\\TGREP
(only sysop)
Syntax: TG(REP) ["<search string>"] <boxcall>

Shows last 2 kBytes of file "trace/t_<boxcall>.bcm" where all S&F
commands are logged in detail. If you add <search string> only those
lines matching to <search string> are shown. You need to add " " if search
string contain spaces. You can use a date or call as <search string>.
\\TIME
Syntax: TI(ME) [-a]

Shows the current time and date. To avoid problems with summer and winter time
you should use UTC. TIME -A shows current time in different formats.
\\TIMEOUTWARNING
(only sysop, init.bcm)
Syntax: TIMEOUTWARNING [ 0 | 1 ]
(default: 1)

Short time before usertimeout has reached, a warning note is shown to user
if this parameter is set to "1". If parameter is set to "0" no warning note
is shown before timeout.

See also HELP USRTIMEOUT
\\TNC
(only sysop, only DOS, option _TNC in config.h)
Syntax: TNC <pcflex command>

You can configure PC/Flexnet with this command (change parameters). Not all
PC/Flexnet commands can be used. If you don't run node (flexdigi) the
changed parameters are not saved, this means they are only used until next
reboot. So you should better use a batch file before starting BBS and
edit FSET lines there. While BBS is normally connected via wire to node
flexnet parameters have only minor importance with exception of baud rate.
If running flexdigi, you should better use direct connect to setup
parameters.

See also HELP TNC TRACE
\\TNC.TRACE
(only DOS, option _TNC in config.h)
TNC TRACE -1         shows all monitor channels
TNC TRACE <channel>  shows only <channel>
TNC TRACE            don't show monitor
Only if BBS monitor is switched off, the TRACE function of flexnet node can
be used.
\\TR=TRANSFER
\\TRACELEVEL
(only sysop, init.bcm)
Syntax: TRACEL(EVEL) [<n>]
(default: 1)

Without parameter the setting is displayed.

The parameter defines which system messages are added to "trace/syslog_r.bcm"
Following values for <n> are possible:

0   All system and error messages (#R, #L, #S, #F, #A) are saved
    (this may be very much, don't use it for long time).
1   All messages except #R are logged.
2   All error messages are logged (#S, #F, #A).
3   Only fatal error messages are logged (#F and #A).
4   Only messages are logged that cause a watchdog abort (#A)
    (only if watchdog is set from 4 to 7)
5   No system messages are logged (don't use this).

Explanation:
#R   (REPORT)   all report messages (user inputs, etc.)
#L   (LOG)      system messages (start, stop, etc.)
#S   (SERIOUS)  error messages without program abort
#F   (FATAL)    fatal error messages with program abort
#A   (ABORT)    error messages with a watchdog program abort
                (only if watchdog is set from 4 to 7)

System messages (#L, #S, #F, #A) are always added to file "trace/syslog.bcm".
The error messages are for programmers to find the bugs. You can use SLR and
SL commands for viewing system messages. You can delete "trace/syslog.bcm"
and "trace/syslog_r.bcm" if they are grown and take a huge part of harddisk.

\\TRANSFER
Syntax: TR(ANSFER) <call | board> <range> [>] <target>
                   [@<boxcall>] [#<lifetime>] [<title>]

Moves a mail into another board or to another user board. It is possible to
specify a new lifetime and/or a new address for S&F. If no range is specified,
the last read mail is used.

Using TRANSFER to a bulletin board the old mail will be deleted, to a
call, the old mail will not be deleted. The BBS will insert a line
"X-Transfer: <date> by ..." and "CP <call>:" to title. If you are the writer
of mail or sysop the "CP <call>:" addition to title is not done.
The ">" sign can be specified, but is not necessary (only for compability).
A mail can only be transfered by the owner (you have to be recipient or sender
of that mail) or by sysop, like ERASE command.
It is not possible to duplicate a bulletin to a board.
While transfering a mail from one board to another, the date of the mail
will be the same. In the target board the transfered mail will be placed at
the end of the board listing (also if the date of the latest mail before
is younger) until a REORG (REORG B) is done. If source and target board is the
same, the date of the mail will be changed to the current date. This can be
used to "sort" mails in the board listing.

Attention: If you want only change the forward address use the FORWARD command.
           If you want only change the liftime use the SETLIFE command.

Examples:   TR BAYCOM 5-6 SOFTWARE           Moves the mails 5-6 from the

TTY S&F via telephone, settings
-------------------------------

  You can use telephone S&F easily with BCM. Knowledge about AT commands
  of phone modems and parameters of "init.bcm" and "fwd.bcm" are provided.
  You need a telephone modem and a serial port with free IRQ. It's also
  possible to use a ISDN card with modem emulation.

  First you have to setup serial port. There are two parameters in "init.bcm":
  TTYMODE is used like in older BCM versions.
  TTYDEVICE configures the modem.

  To use TTY S&F you have to set parameter of TTYDEVICE min. to value "2".
  S&F via nullmodem is possible, but you should better use S&F via KISS if
  using nullmodem cable. The last four parameters of TTYMODE should
  be "N,8,1,E".

  TTYDEVICE <value>

  0    terminal device (default)
  1    nullmodem link (master, use 0 for slave)
  2    telephone modem: if a modem is connected, it's initalised after
       every login cyclus; if a RING signal is detected, BCM takes the line;
       after successful "CONNECT" message TTY behaviour is same like normal
       terminal; if "NO CARRIER" is detected login is stopped; if a login
       is stopped (with "quit", "exit"... or "NO CARRIER") modem sets
       DTR line to low; this is also done after three logins with wrong
       TTY password
  3    telephone modem with check: same as parameter 2, but "getty" is
       automatically terminated if modem is not responding any more or
       if no hangup is possible via DTR line

  In the next step the configuration of file "inittty.bcm" must be done:

  comadr 0                 dezimal address (not HEX!) of serial port, if set
                           to 0, port number defined in "init.bcm" is used and
                           address is set automatically
  comirq 0                 interrupt (IRQ) of serial port, if set to 0 the
                           default IRQ or serial port defined in "init.bcm" is
                           used
  cmdatz ATZ               command for modem initialisation
  cmdata ATA               command for modem to take off
  cmdatd ATD               command for modem dialing
  ringindicator RING       modem code if ringin
  connectindicator CONNECT modem code if connect success
  dailprefix               dailing prefix code
  dailsuffix               dailing suffix code
  ringtimeout 30           waiting time in seconds between takeoff and CONNECT
  dailtimeout 40           waiting time for dialing process until abort, e.g.
                           if target station not available (in seconds)
  daildelay 0              waiting time until next dailing try (in seconds)
  connectdelay 0           waiting time in seconds until next successful
                           connect
  maxcontime 0             time for "maxcons", if set to 0 it's inactive (in
                           seconds)
  maxcons 0                amount of dailing tries during "maxcontime", if set
                           to 0 no limit (in seconds)

  Hint: use "0W" if you have not a direct telephone line as "dailprefix",
  for further information look at your modem/telephone documentation.
  Use commands "maxcontime" and "maxcons" to configure dialing tries. If you
  want to start only one S&F connect per hour, set "maxcontime" to 3600
  and "maxcons" to 1.

  Now you can use telephone modem for S&F and user login. If you want to
  do S&F via tty do following:

  - tty passwords must be the same at both S&F partners and also both
    normal ax25 S&F passwords must be the same
  - use following entry for automatic S&F in file "fwd.bcm":
    instead of connect call and digi use "<call> TTY <nummer>";
    use call without SSID, e.g.
    "DBO812 AAAA...............AAAAA DBO812 TTY 2356";
    the BBS is dialing automatically if S&F parameter is "D"; if there
    is only an "A", BBS is only sending if it's connected by others;
    Example: DBO812 AADDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA DBO812 TTY 7823456
  - if the BBS is called, BBS is take off automatically, if you don't
    want this, use a timeclock for modem.

  Start S&F with "TTYDIAL <call> <nummer>". If tty S&F is configured
  in "fwd.bcm", command "SF <call>" is also working and BBS is dailing
  at all configured times defined in file "crontab.bcm" automatically if
  "maxcontime" and "maxcons" are set. You may use command "TTYSTATUS" to
  show process status. TTY is always using RTS/CTS.

  If you use a slow computer (e.g. 486SX), using of FBB S&F may be
  slow down S&F, because compressing takes more time than using
  uncompressed ASCII S&F and send some more data. So use ASCII protocol
  in those cases, most modems use a hardware compression anyway.

TTY S&F via telephone, usage
----------------------------

  All inputs and outputs can be shown with command "monitor" at "getty" task.
  Here only login screen is visible, if another user or S&F partner is
  logging in, you have to monitor the equivalent task.

  "TTYSTATUS" shows status of serial port
  "TTYWIN" shows outputs in own window

  Following parameters are possible:
  TTY  mode of tty port
  POS  0  wait for ring         (waits for "RING", sends after that "ATA")
       1  busy                  (tty-port is used at the moment, e.g. hangup)
       2  ring, wait connect    (waits for "CONNECT" message from modem)
       3  dialup, wait connect  (waits for "CONNECT" message from modem)
       4  wait for login        (waits for input of call and password)
       5  eingeloggt            (new task is opening)
       /0 /1 dialup             (BBS is called or is dailing at the moment)
  CALL call, logged in at tty port
  TASK number of task, using tty port
  CMD  shows if modem is in command mode
  RX   shows how much rx bytes are in serial buffer, use > for stopping input
  TX   shows how much tx bytes are in serial buffer, use > for stopping output
  LINE baud rate of telephone line (taken from "CONNECT" message)
  ECH  echo mode
       0 no echo
       1 normal echo
       2 "*" are send back (password query)
  Also online time, some variables and tty port errors are shown.

  You can hangup immediately with "kill" of S&F task or use command
  "TTYHANGUP". DTR line is set to LOW at this moment. Modem must be set
  to hangup if getting a DTR Low signal. If this is not set in this way,
  BBS shows a error message and fries or stops "getty" until error
  is solved.

  Use command "TTYCMD" to send modem commands. This is only possible if
  modem is in command mode.

TTY S&F via telephone, solutions
--------------------------------

  - BBS doesn't dial, but can handle dailin's:
    Check parameters "maxcons", "maxcontime" and S&F time in
    file "crontab.bcm"!
  - BBS doesn't allow any logins:
    You need a password for tty port, check if it's set!
  - modem is doing nothing:
    check port parameters, or check if modem is running with normal
    terminal program! Also use command "TTYSTATUS" for some hints.
  - BBS takes off but disconnects immediately:
    modem isn't allowed to take off itself, because BBS is sending
    this command to modem, check documentation of modem to change this
    behaviour.
\\TTYINIT
(only sysop, option FEATURE_SERIAL (Linux) or _TTY (DOS) in config.h)
Syntax: TTYI(NIT)

Initialize a serial port which is defined with TTYMODE.
See also HELP TTYMODE
\\TTYMODE
(only sysop, init.bcm, option FEATURE_SERIAL(Linux) or _TTY(DOS) in config.h)
Syntax:
Linux: TTYM(ODE) [ off | /dev/tty<n> ]
DOS:   TTYM(ODE) [ off | <comnr>:<speed>,<parity>,<dbits>,<sbits>, [ E | L ] ]
(default: off)

Defines parameters used for serial port.

Example for DOS:   ttym 1:9600,n,8,1,e
        for Linux: ttym /dev/tty9

You can switch off TTY port with "ttym off" (default).
The base address of serial port is taken from BIOS (DOS only).

See also HELP TTYFWD and HELP TTYINIT
\\TTYSTATUS
(only sysop, only DOS)
Syntax: TTYSTATUS

Shows status of serial port.

See HELP TTYFWD
\\TTYWIN
(only sysop, only DOS)
Syntax: TTYWIN

Shows outputs in own window.

See HELP TTYFWD
\\TWIN
(only sysop, only DOS)

Syntax: TW(IN) [options]

This command creates a new window if running DOS where all tasks are shown.
The window is refreshed every second.

\\U=USER
\\UFWD
Comments about S&F for user
---------------------------
Every user can send/deliver his mails from and to his own BBS system via
user S&F feature of BCM. To use this feature you have to setup following:

- MYBBS must be set to that BBS that sends mails to user,
  do not set MYBBS to your own BBS!

- to activate forwarding use command
    ALTER UFWD <call> [<digi>]
  and add a valid connect path.

Forwarding to user is started each time when a new mail is received.
If his BBS can not be reached, no further connect tries are done until another
new mail for that call is received.

User BBS can connect everytime to BCM, but BBS call must be connected
with S&F SSID (see also HELP PAR MYCALL).

See also HELP ALTER UFWD and HELP UFWD PASSWORD
\\UFWD.PASSWORD
If user has set a login password this is also needed for user s&f. The
function is same as normal login but the place after SID is used.

Example:
[BayCom-1.38-DH$] 21 34 22 12 3
>
[BayCom-1.38-DH$] sajkdhfeufhndjffjdshfsdf
>

You can change password type with command ALTER SFPWTYPE.

See also HELP ALTER SFPWTYPE
\\UIMPORT
(only sysop, option in config.h)
Syntax: UI(MPORT)
If you install BCM, there is no user database existing. If you have run
Diebox/Thebox system before you can use "uimport" to import a user database
from Thebox system. That are files "user3.dat" and "user3.idx".
\\UNERASE
Syntax: UN(ERASE) [ <call> | <board> ] [<range>]

Makes erased mails visible again. Only with the PURGE command the mails
really will be erased. After PURGE you can not make the mail visible again.
With the ERASE command mails only are marked to be erased and made invisible.
To make the mails readable again you have to use the UNERASE command.
You can specify a range like at the commands DIR, LIST, ERASE, etc.

You can list erased mails with "DIR -KV". After the mail number there will
be shown why the mail has been deleted.
 E  - erased with ERASE command or at the "Erase mail?" prompt
 F  - mail has been forwarded to a other BBS and is therefore deleted
 K  - erased by the sysop with remote erase
 L  - erased by a remote erase
 S  - mail is erased by local sysop
 T  - mail has been transfered to another board and is therefore deleted

Example:   UN DL8MBT 1-   all erased mails of DL8MBT are visible again
\\UNKNOWN
Syntax: UNK(NOWN) ["<search string>"]

Shows last 2 kBytes of file "trace/unknown.bcm" where all mails are added
that can't be forwarded. If you add <search string> only those lines matching
to search string are shown. You need to add " " if search string should
contain spaces. You can use a date or call as search string.

See also HELP SFHOLD and HELP RLOG
\\UNREAD
Syntax: UNR(EAD) [ <call> | <board> ] [<range>]

Marks mail as UNREAD. If a user use this, the R flag of mail is removed.
If a sysop is using this command, also the calls from READ line of mail is
removed.
\\UNSECURETTYPW
(only sysop, init.bcm)
Syntax: UNSECURETTYPW [ 0 | 1 | 2 ]
(default: 0)

This parameter defines how to handle ttypw passwords:
 0   only sysops and user with ttypw already set are allowed to change or delete
     TTYPW.
 1   as 0, and users who have logged in with password are also allowed to
     change their TTYPW.
 2   everybody can change his TTYPW (be careful: other user may can set TTYPW
     for everybody when misusing callsigns! use this only in special cases!)

See also HELP TTYPW
\\USERFORWARD=UFWD
\\USERLIFE
(only sysop, init.bcm)
Syntax: USERL(IFE) [<days>]
(default: 999)

Sets default lifetime for user mails. Sysops should define a value
corresponding to BBS harddisk space.
Value 0 makes no sense and leads automatically to a setting of 999.
999 is the max. value and means no deletion anyway.

Example: USERLIFE 365

See also HELP OLDU
\\USERPATH
(only sysop, init.bcm)
Syntax: USERPA(TH) [<directory>]
(default: "/bcm/user/")

Same like INFOPATH, but only for user mails.

See HELP INFOPATH
\\USERPW
(only sysop, init.bcm)
Syntax: USERPW [ 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 ]
(default: 1)

This command switches the input of user passwords on or off. In most
BBS the input of user passwords is switched off, because there are
some people who misuse this and others set unknown passwords for users.

  USERPW 0    password input disabled
  USERPW 1    password input allowed
  USERPW 2    no SEND without password
  USERPW 3    like 2, but password like DPBox

Existing passwords are always asked at login. When "USERPW 0" is set,
sysops can handle new passwords and users can disable password with
"A PW OFF".

See also HELP PASSWORD
\\USERQUOTA
(only sysop, init.bcm)
Syntax: USERQ(UOTA) [<kBytes>]
(default: 0)

This parameter defines the max. amount of output data per day and user.
If this amount is reached, no further reading or sending is allowed until
next day. Only personal mails are allowed.
USERQUOTA 0 disables this function, which is the default setting and
is the best setting for most cases.

If you set "maxlogins" to another value than 1, the quota function is not
running correctly. So sysops who want to use this feature, have to set
"maxlogins 1".

User can examine with command QUOTA who much data he has transmitted this
day and who much data may left.

See also HELP MAXLOGINS and HELP QUIT
\\USERS
Syntax: U(SERS) [*] | [<call>]

"Support" shows all compiled options of the running version.
"Uptime" shows, how long the software runs without interruption
  (days.hours:minutes).
"CPU" indicates an approximate comparative figure of the speed of the
  computer. The measurement is very inexact and should not be overrated.
"Available Memory" shows the free RAM.
"Swap" is only correct at Linux version of the BCM BBS. At DOS there is a "-".
The other items show the directories of the BBS harddisk and the available
(total) harddisk memory.

  30 min; if watchdog is executed, a cold reboot of pc is done
4 debug mode: before doing any watchdog reset, a syslog entries is tried to
  perform; this may cause the watchdog to stuck, because filesystem have
  to live (#A in file "trace/syslog.bcm").

You can calculate the single values, this means "watchdog 7" activates all
possibilities. Sysops who want to have a stable software running and don't
use a hardware watchdog should use "watchdog 2".
